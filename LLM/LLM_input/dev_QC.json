And perhaps we should also hand over all Palestinian keys to Israel.\u201d\nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, right, is greeted by Hanan Ashrawi, left, legislator and activist, as he arrives at his hotel in New York, Monday, Sept. 19, 2011, to attend the 66th General Assembly session of United Nations.\nPLO Executive Committee member Hanan Ashrawi accused the White House of accommodating the most \u201cextreme and irresponsible\u201d elements in Israel, saying it was no way to conduct foreign policy.\n\u201cIf the Trump administration rejects this [two-state] policy, it will destroy the chances for peace and undermine American interests, standing and credibility abroad,\u201d Ashrawi said in a statement.\nAnd, she added, if the U.S. leader intends to end the two-state solution,he should put alternatives on the table.\nThe Palestinian News and Information Agency quoted a press release by the Palestinian ministry of foreign affairs that cautions against drawing premature conclusions about Wednesday\u2019s meeting in Washington, stating that the new U.S. president is still evaluating the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\nMeanwhile, in Israel, the political right-wing was generally positive about the meeting.\n\u201cTrump Is Good for the Jews,\u201d declared Israel Hayom foreign affairs editor Boaz Bismuth in Israel Hayom, a pro-Netanyahu daily. \"The press conference with Trump and Netanyahu was a U-turn from everything we have heard, known, understood, and considered for decades.\n\"For the most part, the ideas of the two-state solution for peace, road maps, multilateral negotiations, international initiatives, threats of sanctions against Israel, fingers of blame pointed at the settlements, have become irrelevant, or at best, secondary. ... And while the Israeli Left will surely frown upon this formula, only time will tell if the Israeli Right will fully subscribe to it,\" Bismuth continued.\nIsraeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman noted apparent chemistry and trust between Trump and Netanyahu, according to open source reports.\n\u201cIt takes years to build relations between two countries, step by step, and in the first meeting, the critical thing is to build positive personal relations. ... The prime minister ... successfully achieved this,\u201d Lieberman said, adding, \u201cwith respect to the rest, we don\u2019t know exactly what happened.\u201d\nEarlier in the week, Lieberman had suggested the Trump-Netanyahu meeting should focus on another, more important issue: \u201cThe greatest threat to Israel is Iran, Iran and Iran,\u201d he said.\n/*<![CDATA[*/\ninitInfographics(\n{\ngroups:[],\nparams:[{\"Name\":\"embed_html\",\"Value\":\"\\u0026lt;blockquote class=\\\"twitter-tweet\\\" data-lang=\\\"en\\\"\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" lang=\\\"en\\\"\\u0026gt;A new era.

America shouldn\u2019t have to teach them what is best for them.\u201d\nChemi Shalev, the U.S. editor for the left-leaning Haaretz newspaper, wrote: \"Supporters of a peace agreement with the Palestinians had a tough night, for sure, but at least they can console themselves with Trump\u2019s impromptu turn to Netanyahu to 'hold off with settlements for a while' and with his continued lip service to achieving a solution to the conflict.\u201d\nShalev interpreted Trump\u2019s statements as more than just a retraction of U.S. support for a two-state solution.\n\u201cTrump ... distanced himself from the need to take any position whatsoever, preferring a sort of nihilistic formula of one state, two states, whatever, I don\u2019t care,\" Shalev said.\n\n            ",

VX is a highly toxic substance which is classified as a weapon of mass destruction under the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention.\nMalaysian police have detained the women and one North Korean national. Seven other North Koreans, including a diplomat based in the Malaysian capital, are currently wanted for questioning.\nFILE - People watch a TV screen broadcasting a news report on the assassination of Kim Jong Nam, the older half brother of the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, at a railway station in Seoul, South Korea, Feb. 14, 2017.\nAlthough the police are still trying to determine if the North was responsible for the assassination, South Korea's intelligence agency said the killing is state-led terrorism sponsored by the North, according to South Korean lawmakers briefed by the agency.\nCurrently, three countries are on the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism \u2014 Iran, Sudan and Syria. They are subject to U.S. financial sanctions, which include restrictions on U.S. foreign assistance, a ban on arms-related exports and sales, and controls on exports of dual-use items.\nCall for reinstatement\nThe U.S. designated North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism after the country bombed a Korean Air flight near Myanmar in 1987, killing 115 people onboard. Since then, the communist state is not known to have sponsored any terrorist acts, according to the U.S. State Department.\nIn 2008, the U.S. removed the North from the list as part of a nuclear deal, in which Pyongyang agreed to disable its plutonium plant and allow some inspections. However, the North's recent provocations have prompted some U.S. lawmakers to seek to repeal the decision. Following the latest incident in Malaysia, there is another push in Congress to return the North to the terrorism blacklist.\nFILE - A North Korean nuclear plant is seen before demolishing a cooling tower (R) in Yongbyon, in this photo taken June 27, 2008, and released by Kyodo.\nIn order to put North Korea back on the list, the U.S. secretary of state \"must determine\" that the North has \"repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism,\" according to the State Department.\nThis, nonetheless, could be difficult as the U.S. government and Congress have often disagreed on what constitutes state-sponsored international terrorism. The Obama administration refused repeated calls from Congress to reinstate the North to the list, citing the statutory requirement for such action.\nStatutory requirements\nJoshua Stanton, a Washington, D.C.-based attorney who specializes in sanctions and also maintains the influential One Free Korea blog, believes that the assassination of Kim Jong Nam, coupled with its previous bellicose acts, meets statutory requirements to put Pyongyang back on the terrorism blacklist.\nAccording to Stanton, the regime has carried out a series of what he called terrorist acts such as threats to theaters showing the film The Interview, an action-comedy centered on an assassination plot against Kim Jong Un.\u201d\n\"I think it's going to be difficult for the administration to resist the pressure to [return North Korea to the list] at this point,\" Stanton told VOA. \nStanton, who also has assisted the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee with the drafting of North Korea-related legislation, added there is little doubt that the Kuala Lumpur killing was a terrorist act because a banned chemical weapon was used against a civilian at a public airport in a third country.\nAnthony Ruggiero, who worked in the U.S. government for more than 17 years, told VOA that although there is a restricted legal interpretation of what acts of international terrorism look like, the Kim Jong Nam case \"crystalizes the effort to look at North Korea as a terrorist state.\"\nFILE - The car of ambassador of North Korea to Malaysia leaves the forensic department at the hospital in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, Feb. 15, 2017.\n\"I think you can make a case that, at least since 2008, there have been repeated acts of international terrorism, which they have supported, or in the case of Kim Jong Nam, have done themselves,\" said the former Treasury Department official, who is now a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.\nGray zone\nDaniel Benjamin, who served as the U.S. State Department's counterterrorism coordinator in the Obama administration, however, argues that the killing in Malaysia cannot be readily construed as an act of terrorism. In an interview with VOA, Benjamin, who is now the director of the Dickey Center for International Understanding at Dartmouth College, said the case lies in a \"gray zone.\"\nWhile the apparent use of the deadly nerve agent in the killing is within legal parameters of designating the North as a terrorist state, assassination by itself cannot be interpreted as an act of terrorism, according to Benjamin.\n\"So this is a very unusual case,\" said the former official.\n\"The law is written in such a way that I think that the administration has a certain amount of flexibility in determining whether or not a country qualifies as a state sponsor,\" he added.\nCiting a senior South Korean official, South Korean news media reported Monday the U.S. was mulling the reinstatement. In response, a State Department spokesperson said Tuesday the State Department constantly reviews \"all of the available information and intelligence, from a variety of sources\" on the North.\n\"Even without being designated as a State Sponsor of Terrorism, North Korea remains among the most heavily sanctioned countries in the world,\" the spokesperson said in an email sent to VOA.\nCho Eunjung and Baik Sungwon contributed to this report.\n\n            ",

According to the United Nations, more than 43,000 migrants, mostly from sub-Saharan Africa, have reached European shores this year from Libya and a surge in migrant crossings is expected this spring and summer.\nFILE - Sub-Saharan migrants are rescued by members of Proactiva Open Arms NGO at the Mediterranean sea, about 20 miles north of Ra's Tajura, Libya, Jan. 12, 2017.\nNearly 1,200 migrants have died at sea trying to cross the Mediterranean.\nIn their letter, which was first reported by the German weekly newspaper Welt am Sonntag, the ministers, Thomas de Maizi\u00e8re and Marco Minniti, said they \"are convinced that we all must do more\" to \u201cprevent that hundreds of thousands of people once again risk their lives in Libya and on the Mediterranean Sea in the hands of smugglers.\u201d\nThey called for the setting up of \"an EU mission at the border between Libya and Niger as soon as possible,\" which could include mobile patrols and border posts as well as vetting of asylum-seekers. They also want for the EU to help support economic growth and development in communities along the border. \"The goal is as quickly as possible to build up an EU mission on the border between Libya and Niger\" to stop migrants entering war-torn Libya.\nFILE - Illegal migrants arrive by boat at a naval base after they were rescued by Libyan coastguard in the coastal city of Tripoli, Libya, May 10, 2017.\nItaly has borne the brunt of the migration crisis since Europe concluded a deal with Turkey to stem the movement of migrants and war refugees into EU countries. European leaders are worried about a possible rush of newcomers, increasing the pressure on southern European states, such as Italy and Malta, but also roiling further politics on the continent and fueling anti-immigrant and far-right sentiment.\nA scheme to relocate asylum-seekers continues to face stiff opposition from central European countries, especially Hungary and Slovakia.\nThe ministers\u2019 request to the European Commission envisages shifting the EU\u2019s external border in effect to North Africa. It coincides with a warning from U.N. migration officials that hundreds of migrants along sub-Saharan migration routes are being traded openly in \u2018slave markets\u2019 as well as in Libya. The office of the IOM in Niger has reported: \"Sub-Saharan migrants were being sold and bought by Libyans, with the support of Ghanaians and Nigerians who work for them.\"\nFILE - Migrants sit on their belongings in the back of a truck as it is driven through a dusty road in the desert town of Agadez, Niger, headed for Libya, May 25, 2015.\nHow enthusiastic EU member states will be to the request to set up a mission along the Libya-Niger border will partly be colored by the reaction of European military officials, say analysts.\nEU navies alongside the Italian navy have been running a joint mission called Operation Sophia at sea, intercepting smugglers\u2019 boats and picking up migrants to transfer them to centers in Italy. Critics of the operation say the humanitarian rescue mission is a \u2018pull factor\u2019 encouraging migrants to make the journey.\nFILE - Migrants are disembarked from the Italian navy ship 'Vega' in the Sicilian harbour of Augusta, southern Italy, May 4, 2015.\nEU plans proposed in 2015 for EU military forces to be more proactive, including mounting coastal raids to destroy traffickers\u2019 boats, fell to the wayside.\nEuropean defense chiefs were fearful of \u201cmission\u2019 creep\u201d and of being drawn into the conflict in Libya pitting rival governments and militias against each other. In a confidential memo, they warned their political superiors that plans to stop migrant-smuggling boats crossing the Mediterranean would lead inevitably to land operations in Libya and possible clashes with the Islamic State\u2019s affiliate in the North African state. The memo counseling caution was leaked to WikiLeaks.\nFILE - A boy walks past a signboard for the International Migration Organization's transit center in Agadez, Niger, May 11, 2016.\nThe International Organization for Migration estimated that more than a quarter-of-a-million migrants crossed the Libya-Niger border last year. The EU already has five migrant centers located in Niger, part of an effort to vet asylum-seekers and discourage migrants from risking the crossing into Libya and the Mediterranean and putting their lives into the hands of traffickers.\nOne of the three governments vying for control of Libya, the internationally-recognized Government of National Accord, has said it is willing to cooperate with the Europeans, but it has no reliable forces of its own and relies on the volatile backing of some militias whose loyalty could shift unpredictably.\nThe GNA\u2019s vice president told the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera on Sunday, \"the difficult economic situation in that [border] region pushes lots of young people to work for the traffickers.\"\nOn Monday, Italian police chief Franco Gabrielli announced that ships involved in the rescue of asylum-seekers in the Mediterranean won\u2019t be allowed to dock at any port on the island of Sicily until after a G7 summit this month in the town of Taormina. He said the move was designed to ease the burden on police and security agencies for the two-day summit, which begins May 26.\n\n            ",

He spends much of the time looking into the camera, but does not speak.\nIt is unclear when the video was recorded.\nAuthorities had earlier released a grainy image of the suspected shooter taken from security camera footage.\nTurkish media also reported Tuesday that authorities detained two foreign nationals at Istanbul's Ataturk airport in connection with the attack. No other details were given.\nTurkey's Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus told reporters Monday that eight other people had been detained.\nA Turkish police handout picture of a suspect in Istanbul nightclub attack which killed at least 39 people on New Year's Eve, made available Jan. 2, 2017.\nThe attack began early Sunday with the gunman killing a police officer and a civilian outside the Reina nightclub before going inside. There were about 600 people, many of them foreigners, in the club at the time, some of whom jumped into the Bosphorus Strait in order to escape. Authorities said the shooter blended in with people leaving the club. In addition to those killed, about 70 people were injured.\nOn Tuesday, U.S. President Barack Obama spoke by phone with Erdogan to express his condolences. The White House said the two leaders agreed that Turkey and the United States must continue to stand united in order to defeat terrorism. Obama also praised Turkey's ongoing efforts to work with regional players to facilitate a nationwide cease-fire in Syria and a return to political negotiations between the Syrian regime and the opposition.\nA police officer looks at the photographs of the victims as two others stand guard a day after an attack at a popular nightclub in Istanbul, Jan. 2, 2017.\nIS claims responsibility \nIn a statement Monday, Islamic State said one of its \u201cheroic soldiers\u201d carried out the attack and that it targeted Turkey for siding \u201cwith countries of the cross.\" The group said the night club was targeted because it was a place where \u201cChristians celebrated their apostles.\u201d\n\"It was certainly expected that Islamic State would one way or another be linked to the attack,\u201d said political analyst Sinan Ulgen, of EDAM, an Istanbul-based political research group. \"Looking at both the nature of the target, a popular night club, (and) the timing, New Year\u2019s Eve, made it likely to be Islamic State.\u201d\n In a video released last week, Islamic State called on its supporters to launch attacks in Turkey. The video came against the backdrop of the Turkish military\u2019s ongoing battle to wrest control of the strategically important Syrian town of al-Bab from the jihadist group.\nCiting security sources, Turkish media reported Monday the gunman in the nightclub attack is believed to have come from a Central Asian country, either Kyrgyzstan or Uzbekistan. Many Islamic State fighters are drawn from Central Asian countries and have used Istanbul as a base before traveling to fight in Syria.\nExperts say Turkey is paying for the government\u2019s earlier Syrian policy. \u201cTurkey did choose to support Islamist-leaning groups of the Syrian rebel opposition, with the view and expectation that support would accelerate regime change in Syria,\u201d notes analyst Ulgen. \u201cWhat we have seen is these groups have taken advantage of the position of the Turkish government to set up (terror) cells within Turkey, which are now being used against Turkey.\u201c\nLocal media, citing a police report, said that three days before the nightclub attack, 63 suspected Islamic State militants were detained across Turkey, including in Istanbul. The same report said many of those held were from foreign countries and that the same jihadist cell which carried out June\u2019s attack on Istanbul\u2019s Ataturk airport could be behind this latest deadly attack.\nRelatives of Fatih Cakmak, a security guard and a victim of an attack by a gunman at Reina nightclub, react during his funeral in Istanbul, Turkey, Jan. 2, 2017.\nFunerals \nFunerals are continuing for those killed in the New Year's attack, which was the fourth deadly IS attack in Istanbul in a year.\nFor one unnamed mourner there was both anger and despair.\n\u201cThis is where words fail.

We all accomplished a very high intensity training,\u201d said Lieutenant-Colonel Christoph Huber, commander of the NATO enhanced Forward Presence Battle Group, and the German contingent in Lithuania. \u201cAnd, we are prepared to deter and to defend Lithuania.\u201d\nFILE - German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen, left, and Lithuania's President Dalia Grybauskaite attend a ceremony to welcome the German battalion being deployed to Lithuania as part of NATO deterrence measures against Russia in Rukla, Lithuania, F\nNATO is sending additional troops to the Baltics to reassure the former Soviet states against a resurgent Russia, which described the deployment as threatening its security.\nNATO troops\nAfter Russia\u2019s 2014 annexation of Ukraine\u2019s Crimea, NATO agreed to send troops to Lithuania and to Estonia, Latvia, and Poland in a move to deter potential Russian aggression. \nRussia\u2019s military drills and increased buzzing of NATO airspace have raised concerns among Baltic states, which rely on NATO policing for defense. \nNATO jet scrambles to intercept Russian warplanes approaching NATO member airspace jumped from an estimated 400 times in 2014 and 2015 to 800 times in 2016. \n\u201cWe are protecting NATO airspace, NATO borders,\u201d said Major Martin, commander of the Netherlands Air Force Detachment for NATO\u2019s Baltic air policing in Siaulai. \u201cAnd, it is not necessarily just the Russians - it\u2019s any aircraft that does not comply with the rules that we ... that apply in the air.\u201d\nU.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s demand that NATO members pay more for their defense is welcomed by the Baltic states but there is concern that his push for better U.S.-Russia relations not sacrifice their interests.\n\u201cWe do hope that such kind of relations will not create new spheres of influence; no more Yaltas Two; and of course they should not be contrary to the international law as we know it,\u201d said Latvia Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics.\nBuilding a fence\nLithuania is taking measures that include building a fence this year along its open border with Russia\u2019s Kaliningrad. The main purpose of the fence is to prevent smuggling, but there are also concerns about Russia.\n\u201cWell, as I say, we have to be prepared for the worst,\u201d said the Lithuanian Ministry of Defense\u2019s Political Director Vaidotas Urbelis. \u201cProvocations could happen. And, we saw an incident on the Estonian border where one officer was just kidnapped.\u201d\nThe September 2014 incident on the Estonian border raised concern that Russia planned to use the same hybrid warfare techniques on the Baltics that it used to seize Crimea and still employs in eastern Ukraine.\nSandwiched between NATO members Lithuania and Poland, Russia\u2019s Kaliningrad enclave is a strategic, military outpost housing its Baltic Fleet. Russia recently moved a S-400 missile defense system and nuclear capable Iskandar ballistic missiles to Kaliningrad, citing military posturing from NATO.\nSome residents are worried about the potential for conflict.\n\"Because the Kaliningrad region is quite small and many people are quite concerned about that, including us,\u201d said resident Ekaterina who only gave her first name.\nWon't take a risk\nOthers are less concerned.\n\"I do not think that someone would take such a risk. I do not think that both NATO and the European Union are in a hostile mood,\u201d said a resident who identified himself only as Ilya. \u201cThe issue is with our president (Vladimir Putin),\u201d he added.\nJust in case, Baltic states urged NATO to take additional security measures in the region ahead of a Russian September military exercise in neighboring Belarus, which some fear is much larger in scale than reported.\nLithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite in February described Russia\u2019s Zapad 2017 drills as \u201ca very large and aggressive force that will very demonstrably be preparing for a war with the West.\u201d\nRussian state media on Tuesday reported the joint Russia-Belarus exercises involve around 3,000 Russian troops, 280 pieces of hardware and up to 25 Russian aircraft.\nBelarussian President Alexander Lukashenko on Monday invited NATO observers to the drills in an effort to increase transparency. \"We are not hiding and should not hide anything.

Fires broke out in two ministries and several were evacuated. Protesters also set fires in the streets and vandalized government buildings. Images in national media, meanwhile, appeared to show police officers firing weapons, and the Secretariat of Public Security said it was investigating. In all 49, people were injured, including one by a bullet.\nTemer's popularity has been in a freefall since he took office a little more than a year ago after his predecessor was impeached and removed. Some Brazilians consider him illegitimate because of the way he came to power, and his efforts to pass a series of economic reforms to cap the budget, loosen labor laws and reduce pension benefits have only made him even more unpopular. In addition, several of his advisers have been linked to Brazil's massive corruption investigation, known as Operation Car Wash.\nNow, as part of the Car Wash probe, Temer is facing allegations that he endorsed the paying of hush money to a former lawmaker who has been jailed for corruption. Brazil's highest court is investigating him for alleged obstruction of justice and involvement in passive corruption after a recording seemed to capture his approval of the bribe. Temer denies wrongdoing.\nMany Brazilians want him out one way or another: They are calling for him to resign or be impeached. The calls for resignation have heated up since the release of the recording and came to a head in Wednesday's protest, when 45,000 demonstrators took to the streets.\nIn Congress, meanwhile, opposition lawmakers have submitted several requests for his impeachment. Later Thursday, the respected Brazilian bar association plans to submit another such request \u2014 a move that carries symbolic weight since the association is not partisan.\nThe use of troops in the nation's capital is particularly fraught in Brazil, where many still remember the repression of the country's 1964-1985 military dictatorship. Images of soldiers patrolling the streets increased the impression that Temer is struggling to maintain control and further ratcheted up pressure on him.\nTemer defended the decision as necessary to restore order and within his rights.\n\"Order was restored, the respect of life and order was restored,\" Defense Minister Raul Jungmann said in a news conference. He also countered accusations that the move was highly unusual, noting that the military had been called to patrol the streets of cities 29 times since 2010.\n\n            ",

The vote follows several years of unrest and uncertainty in the former British colony.\nAlthough the 1,194 voting members of the Election Committee will cast secret ballots, observers say China has already made clear which of the three candidates it prefers and has even issued a veiled warning through pro-Beijing media that the committee should not trigger a constitutional crisis by voting against the choice of the central government.\nThe risk of that happening ought to be small. A little more than a quarter of the body derives from the pro-democracy camp, which has decided to vote as a bloc. The other three-quarters of the committee are controlled by Beijing.\nThe leading candidate is former chief secretary Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, a career civil servant who stepped down as the city\u2019s number-two official in order to run and is widely believed to be Beijing\u2019s preferred candidate. Critics call her \u201cC.Y. 2.0\u201d and she already has negative poll ratings, below even those of current chief executive C.Y. Leung when he assumed office.\nThe second choice is the more laid-back and popular John Tsang Chun-hwa, a mustachioed former financial secretary who also resigned his cabinet post to be a candidate. He\u2019s been nicknamed Pringles for his resemblance to a potato chip logo.\nChief Executive candidate, Hong Kong's former Financial Secretary John Tsang Chun-wah, center, holds a child as he poses for a photograph with his supporters at a election campaign in Hong Kong, March 16, 2017.\nThe third candidate is retired judge Woo Kwok-hing, a surprise entrant with no government experience. Hong Kong\u2019s pan-democratic groups do not back him even though his positions on issues may be the closest to theirs.\nRonny Tong, a former legislator who now heads the Path of Democracy think-tank, told VOA in an online interview that he doubts if any of the three candidates could be popularly accepted.\n\u201cLook at the way Carrie (Lam) is being vilified every day. Go to her (Facebook) page and you will see the opposition is so much greater than when C.Y. was elected. On the other hand, John Tsang is not getting any support from the pro-government people or Beijing, and I fear if he gets elected we may face a greater constitutional crisis -- divided over where we are going, over how One Country-Two Systems should go on -- (and) everything Beijing stands for the pan-democrats will oppose,\u201d he said.\nOne Country-Two Systems is the China-approved constitutional arrangement under which Hong Kong is allowed a capitalist system, the Common Law legal system and a high degree of autonomy.\nThe winning candidate must get at least 601 votes, one more than half the official size of the 1,200-member election committee. Leung received 689 votes in his election, a number that became his pejorative nickname thereafter. The pan-democrats hold some 325 votes on the election body. In the absence of a truly popular mandate, Beijing wants Lam to secure no less than 700 votes and preferably more than 800 in order to have a victory that appears convincing.\nHong Kong chief executive candidates, former Chief Secretary Carrie Lam, center, former Financial Secretary John Tsang Chun-wah, left, and former judge Woo Kwok-hing attend a chief executive election debate in Hong Kong, March 14, 2017.\nLeverage \nDavid Zweig, chair professor of social science at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and a longtime analyst of politics here, said this small-circle method of choosing the territory\u2019s leader has little to do with a free election.\n\u201cThe population in general has very little leverage on the candidates because it doesn\u2019t really matter what the population thinks about them. You want to please these 1,200 people and you want to please 800 of them if you want to have a decent electoral victory and that\u2019s it.\u201d\nZweig says Lam appears to have been all but anointed as victor in the pro-Beijing news media, making it likely that she will carry the day.\nTsang\u2019s chances as a challenger recently took a major hit. Some thought tycoon Li Ka-shing, who controls numerous votes through his family, affiliated businesses and friends, might vote with the pan-democratic bloc, giving Tsang a shot at victory. But the Li group recently indicated that it\u2019s supporting Lam.\nThe worry that Tsang won\u2019t deliver also puts him at a disadvantage, said Jean-Pierre Cabestan, head of the Political Science Department and professor at Hong Kong Baptist University\n\u201cClearly, John Tsang is more of a unifier. Now the trouble is whether he will be able to deliver. He has made some promises in terms of relaunching the political reform platform and trying to convince Beijing to be more flexible\u201d on universal suffrage \u2013 pledges that China may not support, the professor said.\nZweig said Lam has benefited from Beijing\u2019s arm-twisting.\n\u201cPeople were definitely pressured. The central government in Beijing, as far as we know, has put pressure on lots of people in the committee to vote for Carrie, because they prefer Carrie and Carrie wants to be able to get at least 800 votes of this 1,200.\u201d\nPolitical reform plan \nUnder Beijing\u2019s political reform plan, which sparked months of street protests and was rejected by the Hong Kong legislature in 2014, China would have controlled the process of selecting candidates, but these nominees would have then had to stand in a general election by universal suffrage.\nZweig said any further discussion of reform appears off the table.\n\u201cMy contacts, people that I know who work in Hong Kong for the government in Beijing, make it very clear that there will be no discussion within the next five years and that as far as they\u2019re concerned the democrats shut the door on what Beijing saw as some gradual progress.\u201d\nBut Tong, who formerly belonged to the pro-democratic Civic Party, disagrees.\n\u201cDon\u2019t underestimate the value of the process of trying to restart political reform, \u201che said. \u201cIf we do it in a rational way and start engaging each other, it will improve relations, even if we ultimately will fail.\u201d\n\n            ",

It would be wrong to speculate about the sincerity or insincerity of their statements, nor does it even mean anything, as no one can make free decisions under such conditions,\" Rubin said. \"I don't want to comment on specific demands as that could disrupt ongoing efforts. I am sure the U.S. and Australian and Afghan governments are doing their utmost.\"\nMichael Kugleman, a Pakistan- Afghanistan analyst at the Wilson Center, said, \"Watching this video is heartbreaking.

Hundreds of fans in Trans Ams made it to Atlanta to celebrate the 40th anniversary of \"Smokey and the Bandit\" this weekend.\nReynolds to attend\nThis weekend, they plan to re-create some of the movie's memorable scenes, including a stunt driver's attempt to jump 150 feet (45 meters) through the air in a Trans Am. Also planned: a Burt Reynolds look-alike contest.\nReynolds himself will also be in attendance, and will take part in a question-and-answer session in a city park, Jonesboro City Manager Ricky Clark Jr. said.\n\"People are coming from all over the U.S. and other countries,\" Clark said. \"I got a message from someone from Switzerland who is flying over for this event.\"\nSmokey and the Bandit was among the first big-budget movies to be filmed in Georgia, paving the way for more recent films such as The Hunger Games movies and TV shows such as AMC's The Walking Dead.\nMany of the scenes from Smokey and the Bandit were filmed on Main Street in downtown Jonesboro, nearby U.S. Highway 41 and other roads in the area, Clark said.\nBandit's jump\nSome of the buildings still stand. The city's train depot that dates to 1867 appears in the movie, but moviemakers temporarily replaced its Jonesboro sign with one that said \"Texarkana\" so they could film scenes set in the town on the Texas-Arkansas line. That's where the movie's main characters picked up the 400 cases of Coors beer they would deliver to Atlanta in 28 hours. Participants in the anniversary celebration plan to re-create the \"Coors scene\" at the spot where it was filmed in Jonesboro this weekend.\nA stunt man driving a Trans Am had also had hoped to re-create the Bandit's jump across the Flint River west of downtown Jonesboro. The leap allowed Reynolds and his passenger, Sally Field, to evade the pursuing law officers, whose patrol cars plunged into the river seconds later.\nBut organizers decided another jump at the river site, now overtaken by weeds, wasn't feasible. So they will instead re-create the jump at Atlanta Motor Speedway Saturday evening.\n\n            ",

The new atmosphere of goodwill, along with concerns about potentially provoking the unpredictable president, could give Trump leverage in extracting concessions from the sides.\nFILE - U.S. presidential adviser Jared Kushner, center, and his wife, Ivanka Trump, daughter of President Donald Trump, greet members of the Israeli delegation after a joint news conference between the president and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the East Room of the White House in Washington, Feb. 15, 2017.\nKushner, whose family has a long relationship with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, met with the Israeli leader in Jerusalem for about 3\u00bd hours before heading to the West Bank city of Ramallah for a late-night meeting with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.\nVideo of arrival\nNetanyahu's office released a short video showing Kushner, along with envoy Jason Greenblatt and U.S. Ambassador David Friedman, arriving at the Israeli premier's office in Jerusalem.\nNetanyahu warmly greeted Kushner with a smile and hug. \"This is an opportunity to pursue our common goals of security, prosperity and peace,\" Netanyahu said.\n\"The president sends his best regards and it's an honor to be here with you,\" Kushner said.\nReporters were barred from covering the meetings and did not have an opportunity to ask Kushner questions.\nTrump has tasked Kushner with the ambitious goal of laying the groundwork for what he calls the \"ultimate deal\" \u2014 but deep divisions remain, clouding chances of a significant breakthrough in one of the longest Mideast crises.\nThis month marked the 50th anniversary of the 1967 Mideast war \u2014 a seminal event in which Israel captured the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip.\nThe Palestinians claim these territories for their future independent state. Netanyahu opposes a return to the 1967 lines and also rejects any division of Jerusalem. The eastern part of the city, which the Palestinians claim as their capital, is home to sensitive Jewish, Muslim and Christian holy sites.\nThe White House appeared to play down expectations for a breakthrough ahead of the visit, saying that \"forging a historic peace agreement will take time\" and that Kushner and Greenblatt will most likely make \"many visits\" to the region.\nFor now, the United States is expected to pressure each side to make goodwill gestures in hopes of improving the overall climate.\nThat means putting pressure on Israel to restrain its construction of settlements on occupied lands sought by the Palestinians. It also could mean working with Israel to take new steps to help improve the struggling Palestinian economy, such as easing restrictions to allow more development of West Bank lands.\nSecurity concerns\nAt a security conference on Tuesday, Israeli Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon spoke of the need for economic cooperation and said he was open to promoting Palestinian development as long as it does not threaten Israeli security.\n\"I personally believe that the most important thing between people is mutual trust,\" Kahlon said. \"The Palestinians can hear me say no and refuse some requests, but whenever daily life can be improved, I am there.\"\nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas meets with White House senior adviser Jared Kushner in the West Bank city of Ramallah, June 21, 2017.\nThe Palestinians, meanwhile, will come under pressure to halt what Israel sees as incitement to violence in their official media, speeches and social media.\nIsrael has also demanded that the Palestinians stop making welfare payments to families of militants who are either imprisoned or were killed while committing attacks on Israelis. Israel says the so-called \"Martyrs' Fund\" provides an incentive for Palestinian violence.\nA senior Palestinian official said that a preparatory meeting with Greenblatt on Tuesday had not gone well and became tense over the Martyrs' Fund. He said the Americans \"are buying\" Netanyahu's complaints about Palestinian incitement, and that Greenblatt was insisting on an end to the welfare payments.\nThe official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was discussing a closed diplomatic meeting, said the Palestinians had rebuffed Greenblatt's pressure and demanded an Israeli settlement freeze. He said a Palestinian delegation would head to Washington next month for further talks.\nEven before Kushner's meetings began, there were other signs of trouble.\nOn the eve of his arrival, Israel broke ground on a new West Bank settlement for residents of an illegally built outpost that was dismantled in February under orders from the Supreme Court.\nPM's commitment\nNetanyahu had vowed to compensate the residents of Amona with the new settlement, built on a nearby site in the northern West Bank.\n\"The people of Amona really appreciate his efforts and the efforts from his office in fulfilling this commitment that started to come alive to create this new community,\" said Avichai Boaron, a spokesman for the settlers.\nThe move has infuriated the Palestinians, who say all settlements are illegal obstacles to peace. The international community also widely opposes the settlements.\n\"This is the way Netanyahu is meeting Trump's envoys,\" said Mustafa Barghouti, a Palestinian official. The question, he said, is whether the Trump administration will tell Israel to stop settlement activities or choose to accept this \"Israeli provocation.\"\nAfter arriving early Wednesday, Kushner paid a condolence visit to the grieving family of a young female Israeli police officer who was killed by Palestinian attackers last weekend in Jerusalem. Kushner said Trump asked him to personally convey the condolences of the American people.\nThousands attended Hadas Malka' funeral on Saturday night. Netanyahu visited her grieving family on Sunday and called the 23-year-old woman \"everybody's daughter and everybody's hero.\" He also criticized Abbas for not condemning the attack.\nThe U.S. Embassy said the visit was private and gave no further details.\n\n            ",

Suddenly, the canine moaned \u2014 it had been shot with an anesthetic dart from a blowpipe. It ran several steps, then fell immobilized.\nThe cream-and-gray colored dog was collected by a worker for a new shelter where it will be given a medical check, neutered and microchipped \u2014 the first such initiative in this country where strays in the street are usually killed.\nThe Aradkouh Stray Dogs Shelter has been hired by the Tehran city government to take a new, more humane approach to deal with the burgeoning problem of stray dogs in the capital. It's a sign of changing attitudes among officials in a country where Islamic authorities have long seen dogs as \"un-Islamic\" and at times still confiscate them from people who have dogs as pets and walk them in public or drive with them in their cars.\nA Tehran urban animal control worker shoots dog with anesthetic dart from a blowpipe on the outskirts of the capital Tehran, Iran, March 5, 2017.\nAlthough there are no official numbers, in some Tehran neighborhoods \u2014 especially in poorer districts \u2014 strays are rampant and a nuisance and the shelter captures 30 to 40 dogs per day. District 18, for example, a poor neighborhood in Tehran's southwest known for its farmland, brick furnace towers, junkyards and factories, has some of the most stray dogs in the city.\n\"This area has a countless number of dogs and sometimes they pass by in hordes,\" said Einollah Ardalanisaid, a garage owner in southern Tehran who hailed the initiative that began less than a year ago. \"I think it is great if these dogs can be collected in a managed way so that neither the dogs nor the citizens are harmed.\"\nThe shelter, located near the small town of Kahrizak, caters to the captured dogs' needs, including feeding them and examining them for disease. Shelter workers vaccinate the dogs and sterilize them to control the stray population. After about two weeks, the dogs are microchipped and registered in a data bank so they can be tracked down later. The facility is equipped with surgery rooms, sonography machines and a kitchen.\nOn a recent day, there were 500 mature dogs and 145 puppies being looked after by the shelter's staff. All the dogs are available for adoption.\nStray dogs that have been caught are put inside the vehicle of Tehran's urban animal control after being shot with anesthetic darts on the outskirts of the capital Tehran, Iran, March 5, 2017.\nUrban animal control vehicles set off in the mornings to hunt for strays, their destination determined by reports from citizens or places where the population of the animals is conspicuously large. The staff's hunting tools are blowpipes or guns armed with dart syringes filled with anesthetic drugs.\nThe workers are trained to try to catch the animals as gently as possible and are advised not to use force.\nIn Islam, dogs are seen as unclean. However, police dogs, shepherd dogs and rescue dogs are common, and there have been no reports of clerical backlash against the shelter's operations.\nPrior to the shelter's arrival, the preferred method of dealing with stray animals was to shoot them dead.\nIn one horrific case in 2015, dogs were injected with a deadly substance, presumably acid. Videos were published on social media showing dogs dying while moaning in agony. The videos quickly went viral, sparking widespread outrage and prompting protests by animal rights activists and celebrities.\nAn animal activist who filmed the dog killings in the city of Shiraz in central Iran claimed that private contractors were paid about $4 for each dog they killed. Local authorities denied having any role in the incident.\nSince the advent of the shelter, municipal authorities claim that not a single dog is killed inhumanely and that the animals are being treated in a far more civil manner.\nA Tehran's urban animal control worker treats stray dogs at Aradkouh Stray Dogs Shelter in a southern outskirt of the capital Tehran, Iran, March 5, 2017.\nHassan Heidari, director of Tehran's Urban Animal Control Department, told The Associated Press that killing dogs or any other animals is against Islamic teachings and animal rights.\n\"From a moral and Islamic point of view, we are not allowed to treat these animals violently,\" he said. \"Observance of animal rights was another motive that made us stop killing dogs.\n\"We are now catching them alive despite its costs and troubles,\" he added. \"Today, with God's grace, we have accomplished a very useful and pleasant achievement.\"\nAfter shooting the dogs with the darts, the animals are placed in the air-conditioned rear compartments of the dog-catcher vehicles.\nUpon arrival at the shelter, after being fed and checked for illness, some dogs are neutered or treated with medicine in the facility's clinic and can spend 15 to 45 days there recovering. The dogs are then given to animal supporters who adopt them, or they are released into the wild.\nDogs that are not adopted receive a collar and a microchip that contains the dog's full history.\nDr. Hamid Ghahremanzadeh, the Canadian-educated veterinarian who runs the shelter, says staffers make an effort to find the dogs a home.\n\"We make arrangements to give [adopters] a registered dog with an ID,\" he said. \"If there is no adopter, we will release the sterilized dog at the same spot where we took them.\"\n\n            ",

One day when a fighter came to collect and burn the students' desks, teacher Thiernd Ouronfei decided he'd had enough.\n\"I said he must put the kids' desks down. They hit me in the head with a knife and I was sent to the hospital for at least a week,\" he said. Even now, after the school in Central African Republic was liberated, parents are scared to send their children, he told The Associated Press.\nSome 20 percent of schools in Central African Republic are not functioning, and students' and teachers' lives are threatened as armed groups have looted, occupied and damaged the properties in the conflict-torn country, according to a Human Rights Watch report released Thursday. An education is a rare opportunity for children in the impoverished country to get ahead.\n\"We're talking about a lost generation. These are students who aren't going to get those years back,\" said Lewis Mudge, the group's Africa researcher and co-author of the report. \"Many rebels have also been quite open that they are going to reoccupy schools during the upcoming rainy season.\"\nCentral African Republic descended into conflict in 2013 when the mostly Muslim Seleka rebels overthrew the Christian president. The Christian anti-Balaka militia retaliated with a backlash against Muslim civilians.\nWhile the country held successful democratic elections last year, many remote areas remain outside the government's control. Violence by armed groups has risen sharply since October. Various armed groups have used the schools as bases for years.\nHuman Rights Watch, which visited schools between November and January and interviewed children and teachers as well as fighters, has called on the country's government and the United Nations to do more to ensure that armed groups stay far away from classrooms. In some cases, fighters may vacate a school, but still operate meters away.\nOne student in Ngadja in Ouaka province told Human Rights Watch that he feared for his life after Seleka fighters occupied a nearby school on and off for more than two years.\n\"I often ask myself, 'Should I even bother to go to school? Is it worth the risk?'\" he said.\nThe Seleka rebels for months used the school director's office as a prison, teachers in Ngadja told the rights group.\n\"I'm afraid of the Seleka hanging around the school. So I can't go, and that makes me just as uneducated as an animal,\" a 15-year-old student in Mbres, Nana Grebizi province, told the rights group. In Mbali, Ouham province, a 16-year-old said classes finally started again in November after three years, \"but they had burned all the books, and we don't have any left.\"\nAn 18-year-old student said he had lost four years of his life because he wasn't able to study. \"I want to be a doctor, but the Seleka are blocking my future.\"\nIn November, the U.N. humanitarian office estimated that while 2,336 schools in Central African Republic were operational, at least 461 were not because of insecurity, destruction, occupation and lack of teachers.\nCentral African Republic's government in 2015 committed to protecting schools from attack and military use and permitted U.N. forces to clear them. Progress was made but then undermined when U.N., African Union and French forces in some cases occupied schools themselves, Human Rights Watch said. Once U.N. officials were informed, they left, the group said.\n\"If there are to be any meaningful attempts at peace or at reconciliation, it's important to restart these structures that provide a degree of normalcy,\" Mudge said.\n\n            ",

Asked before the meeting began if he still wanted Mexico to pay for the border wall, Trump said, \"Absolutely.\"\nMexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray, who took part in the 30-minute meeting, said the issue of the border wall did not come up in the actual talks. Trump called Pena Nieto a friend and said the two made \"very good progress\" in talks about the North American Free Trade Agreement.\nPena Nieto said the meeting would \"help us continue a very strong dialogue\" on NAFTA, which Trump has pledged to renegotiate with Mexico and Canada.\nVidegaray said he expected talks on renegotiating NAFTA to start on August 16, the earliest possible date.\nTrump has threatened to impose tariffs on Mexican goods to protect U.S. business interests, and to pull out of NAFTA if he cannot rework it in the United States' favor.\nThe White House said Trump and Pena Nieto also discussed drug trafficking, illegal migration and the crisis in Venezuela.\nPena Nieto was scheduled to be among Trump's first international White House guests, but abruptly canceled the visit after Trump insisted Mexico would pay for the construction of a planned border wall along the U.S.-Mexican border.\nPena Nieto maintains that Mexico will not pay for the wall.\nSince the cancellation of the trip, Trump and Pena Nieto have spoken by phone, and a series of high-level meetings between the two countries have eased the tensions.\nU.S. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, left, and Mexico's Interior Secretary Miguel Angel Osorio Chong arrive for a press conference in Mexico City, July 7, 2017.\nOn Wednesday, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly traveled to Mexico and met with Pena Nieto.

The video of the 2014 shooting, which the city fought to keep secret, inspired large protests and cost the city\u2019s police superintendent his job.\nThe report\u2019s conclusions were unsparing, blaming \u201csystemic deficiencies\u201d within the department and the city, including insufficient training and a failure to hold bad officers accountable for misconduct. Officers endangered civilians, caused avoidable injuries and deaths, and eroded community trust that is \u201cthe cornerstone of public safety,\u201d said Vanita Gupta, head of the Justice Department\u2019s civil rights division.\nThe federal government\u2019s recommendations follow an especially bloody year on Chicago streets. The city logged 762 homicides in 2016, the highest tally in 20 years and more than the combined total of the two largest U.S. cities, New York and Los Angeles.\nMayor Rahm Emanuel said the results of the investigation were sobering and pledged to make changes beyond those the city has adopted, including de-escalation training and stricter use-of-force policies. Federal authorities and city officials have signed an agreement that offers a broad outline for reform, including commitments to improved transparency, training and accountability for bad officers. The Justice Department and the city will negotiate a final settlement to be enforced by the courts.\nFILE - Attorney General Loretta Lynch speaks at a news conference, Sept. 22, 2016, at the Justice Department in Washington. The Justice Department is moving forward with its plans to collect data on how often law enforcement officers use force.\nBuilding a safer city \nAttorney General Lynch said the report lays \u201cthe groundwork for the difficult but necessary work of building a stronger, safer, and more united Chicago for all who call it home.\u201d\nShe was pressed to address questions about the fate of the investigation under the Trump administration, and she insisted that talks between Chicago and the federal government about police reforms would continue regardless \u201cof who is at the top of the Justice Department.\u201d\nThe Justice Department has opened 25 investigations in the last eight years, including into police in Cleveland, Albuquerque and Ferguson, Missouri. Many of them have ended with consent decrees, which are submitted in court and commit an agency to major changes. Officials have moved quickly to resolve major cases before the end of the administration, reaching a consent decree with Baltimore on Thursday. They\u2019ve yet to announce conclusions in a handful of investigations.\nTrump nominee ambivalent \nAt his confirmation hearing this week, Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, who is Trump\u2019s pick for attorney general, expressed ambivalence about the federal review process. He said he was concerned that broad investigations of police departments risk smearing an entire agency and harming officer morale.\nJonathan Smith, a former Justice Department civil rights attorney who oversaw investigations into police forces, said it\u2019s logical for the department to want to conclude the investigation before a new administration comes in, regardless of the party. He said he expected a consent decree to be reached given the connection between the violence in Chicago, which has attracted Trump\u2019s attention, and the Police Department\u2019s troubles.\n\u201cMoving forward, people are going to have to do something, and I think they will,\u201d he said.\nLess confident were Black Lives Matter activists in Chicago, who said they did not trust Emanuel to follow through with vows to pursue reforms.\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe him any more than I believed him when he said that he never saw the Laquan McDonald video before the public saw it,\u201d said Arewa Karen Winters, who said she was the great-aunt of 16-year-old Pierre Loury, who was fatally shot by police last year.\nLynch, in an interview with The Associated Press this week, said it was the federal government\u2019s job to investigate and hold police accountable.\nChicago brutal reputation \nThe Chicago department, with 12,000 officers, has long had a reputation for brutality, particularly in minority communities. The most notorious example was Jon Burge, a commander of a detective unit on the South Side. Burge and his men beat, suffocated and used electric shock for decades starting in the 1970s to get black men to confess to crimes they did not commit.\nChicago has spent more than half a billion dollars to settle claims of police misconduct since 2004, but police did not conduct disciplinary investigations in half of those cases, the report says. Of 409 police shootings that happened over a five-year period, police found only two were unjustified.\nThe Justice Department criticized the city for setting up barriers to getting to the bottom of police misconduct, including provisions in union agreements, a failure to investigate anonymous complaints or those submitted without a supporting affidavit, and a \u201cpervasive cover-up culture.\u201d\nThe report said that witnesses and accused officers were frequently never interviewed at all, that evidence went uncollected and that witnesses were routinely coached by union lawyers, \u201ca dynamic neither we nor our law enforcement experts had seen to nearly such an extent in other agencies.\u201d\nThe head of Chicago\u2019s police union said the Justice Department hurried the investigation to release its findings before Trump takes office. In a statement sent minutes before the report was posted online, Fraternal Order of Police President Dean Angelo questioned whether the investigation was compromised because of its timing.\n\n            ",

There is no link between Islam and radicalism.\"\nSpeaking in the Indonesian language, the minister said the 15-minute Capitol Hill meeting had left her with the belief that the United States understands that Indonesia is a strong, pluralistic and democratic country, and that Islam, the predominant faith in Indonesia, is not an obstacle to positive relations with the United States.\nShe said the two agreed that Indonesia, with the world's largest Muslim population, could play a \"very important\" role in the fight against international terrorism, \"especially through 'soft power,' because that's where our strength is.\"\nFILE - President Donald Trump signs the initial executive order for a U.S. travel ban, Jan. 27, 2017, at the Pentagon.\nTravel ban\nRetno's remarks masked her reaction to the Trump administration's initial travel ban covering seven Muslim-majority nations.

Salafism, which is much stricter than Indonesia's traditional practice of Islam, has been growing in part because of Saudi Arabian funding.\nRetno said she and Ryan also discussed efforts to maintain and strengthen the strategic partnership between the two countries, cooperation on trade and investment cooperation, and the long-running dispute between Israel and the Palestinians.\nThe minister's two-day visit to Washington follows a visit to Jakarta last month by Vice President Mike Pence. In addition to her meeting with Ryan, Retno met with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Talks with Pence and Thomas P.

More than 1 million people died during Nigeria\u2019s 1967 to 1970 civil war known as the Biafra War The conflict erupted after leaders from southeastern Nigeria declared that the region would secede from Nigeria. \nMemories of the war remain strong for those who lived through it.\n\u201cHave you been walking with somebody and the bomb killed him and all you have to do is look at the corpse and continue walking? Even if it\u2019s your sister, you just continue walking because you\u2019re running for dear life? Or have you been hidden in the roof of a building because you are afraid, because your mother is afraid the soldiers will come and rape you?\u201d says Enuma Okoro, who was 21 when the war broke out.\n\u201cIn my compound we saw several skeletons of dead people. My father\u2019s compound was flattened. It was a war front,\u201d says Obum Okeke, who was 7 years old when the war started.\nFILE - A group of starving Biafran children wait at Aba for doctors to see them, July 27, 1968.\nImages sifted opinion\nThe war gained widespread global attention once pictures of starving Biafran children were published in the international media. The Nigerian government had formed a blockade, making it difficult for aid groups to reach Biafra. Many children starved and developed a severe condition that became known as kwashiorkor.\n\u201cFirst of all, the first thing you notice is the stomach bloated,\" says Christopher Ejiofor, a traditional king in his community in the southeastern state of Enugu and the aide to Chukwuemeka Ojukwu, a military officer and leader of the short-lived Republic of Biafra. \"The arms to the bones, the legs to the bones, the thigh to the bones, the head, skull. Can you imagine that? That is a starving a child. And that is what happened everywhere in Biafra,\u201d he says.\nChristopher Ejiofor, a traditional king, known as an igwe, in his community in the southeastern state of Enugu. During the war, he served as the aide-de-camp to Chukwuemeka Oujwku, a military office and the leader of Republic of Biafra.\nThe war ended with the surrender of Biafra in January 1970. Biafrans returned to Nigeria and the country once known as Biafra, ceased to exist. But in recent years, the pro-Biafra movement has resurged. Supporters say the grievances that led to the war have still not been addressed.\nPoll: growing support\nA survey released this week from a Nigerian research group revealed that the pro-Biafra movement is gaining support, particularly among young people who did not experience the war. The rise could also be a reaction for a region that has received little infrastructural development from the federal government.\n\u201cI am supporting it [Biafra] because that is who I am,\u201d says senior university student Sofuru Afah. \u201cNigeria is an artificial creation by the British. I am not a Nigerian and I have never been and I never will. Buhari hates our people.\u201d \nNigerian President Muhammadu Buhari fought against Biafra during the civil war as a young soldier. He says he will not tolerate the Biafra movement. Under Buhari\u2019s administration, Nnamdi Kanu, leader of one of the more popular pro-Biafra groups, called IPOB, was detained in 2015 on charges of treason, criminal conspiracy and belonging to an illegal society. Kanu was released on bail last month after spending nearly two years in prison in the Nigerian capital of Abuja.\nIPOB\u2019s deputy, Uche Mefor, told VOA the Nigerian government cannot ignore the voice of Biafrans. He says May 30 will be a day for the world to recognize because pro-Biafrans will unite in peaceful resistance. Some pro-Biafrans will stay in their homes while others plan to join street rallies.\n\u201cThe compliance on that day will indeed convince the world that the people of Biafra are actually ready for their self-governance. We have our right to self-existence and it doesn\u2019t matter what anybody things about it,\u201d he told VOA.\nThe Nigerian government is determined to preserve Nigeria. Speaking at a Biafra remembrance forum in Abuja this week, acting president Yemi Osinbajo said Nigeria should remain one and all Nigerians should strive to achieve an ideal Nigeria.\n\u201cWe are not there yet, but I believe we have a strong chance to advance in that direction. But that will not happen if we allow our frustrations and grievances to transmute into hatred,\u201d Osinbanjo said during the address.\nLawrence Akpu and other disabled Biafra war veterans gather to discuss their support for the pro-Biafra movement. They want southeastern Nigeria to secede and form the country of Biafra.\nBut, the message of one Nigeria is too late for many people like Lawrence Akpu, a former Biafran fighter. During the war, shrapnel cut into his spinal cord. Today, he\u2019s confined to a wheelchair. Even though he\u2019s poor and begs for handouts, he says he doesn\u2019t regret fighting for Biafra and will fight again.\n\u201cIf we join our hands together to seek Biafra, we shall get Biafra. Because we have no place in Nigeria,\u201d Akpu says.\nAkpu joins a group of other disabled Biafra War veterans on a hot afternoon. They reminisce about the war and soon, they begin to sing the war songs that kept their spirits inspired to keep fighting.\n\n            ",

But he is still under tight surveillance by secret police, according to his wife.\nA court in the central Chinese city of Changsha has yet to announce a verdict, and legal experts say a ruling may not come any time soon.\nRights groups suspect that Xie\u2019s swift release is likely a trade-off and another way of controlling rights advocates without having to put them in formal detention, a tactic that will make it harder for the international community to keep the pressure on.\nNo genuine freedom\nXie\u2019s wife, Chen Guiqiu, has fled China and is now in the United States with her two daughters.\n\u201cEscorted by secret police, Xie Yang arrived home on May 9 to celebrate his mother\u2019s 80th birthday. But hours later was taken away along with his [octogenarian] parents to a residence in a remote village deep into the mountains. He still has no genuine freedom,\u201d Chen told VOA.\nChen says that when she spoke with Xie on Wednesday, her husband sounded indifferent when she shared details of the intimidation and harassment suffered by their family while in China and recounted their escape in March to the United States.\nShe said she thinks it was inconvenient for Xie to speak freely, but also noted that his responses were strange and abnormal. Chen said her husband demanded she and their daughters return to China from the United States, promising that Chinese authorities would keep the family safe.\nDespite this, Chen said their daughters were overjoyed to learn of their father\u2019s release.\n\u201cThey are thrilled, in particular, my eldest daughter burst into tears after learning of his release. [They] miss their father very much. It\u2019s been almost two years since they last saw their father, who was arrested without any warning,\u201d Chen said, adding that she holds little hope that Xie will one day be allowed to visit them in the U.S.\nA photo described as the trial showing human rights lawyer Xie Yang which is seen on the social media of the Changshai Intermediate People's Court is displayed on a computer in Beijing, May 8, 2017.\nTrade-off\nThe family\u2019s lawyer, Chen Jiangang, who was denied access to Monday\u2019s trial, believes Xie\u2019s release is part of a trade-off.\nHe insisted what he disclosed in January about Xie\u2019s torture by Hunan police was based on Xie\u2019s own words during their meetings, even though his client denied the allegations in court.\nNow that Xie has successfully been silenced, Chen said authorities are working to shut him up as well. Chen\u2019s family was briefly detained in the southern province of Yunnan last week.\n\u201cXie Yang lied and denied being tortured. That helped the Chinese government save face and, in return, the Chinese government would promise to let him keep his license. This is a trade-off,\u201d Chen told VOA.\n\u201cWhy are they after me? They are seeking revenge as I was the one who made public his allegations of torture,\u201d which invited criticism from 11 countries, he added.\nAnother show trial\nFrances Eve, a researcher with Chinese Human Rights Defenders, said Xie\u2019s release, likely in exchange for his guilty plea, was the government\u2019s latest show trial to incriminate rights defenders.\nShe said as the 19th Communist Party Congress draws closer, China appears to be pushing the cases of rights lawyers through the judicial system because holding them in pre-trial detention easily becomes \u201ca lightning rod for international criticism.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a way to control people without having them in formal detention, which is harder for international advocacy efforts to keep the pressure on because it\u2019s harder to know what is exactly happening to them when they\u2019re kind of just being controlled in house arrest [or] surveillance,\u201d Eve said.\nFILE - This image made from Aug. 1, 2016 video shows Chen Guiqiu, left, has lunch with lawyer Jiang Tianyong after attending a trial for human rights lawyer and activists at the Tianjin No. 2 Intermediate People's Court in Tianjin, China.\nKeep speaking up\nBut such tactics are unlikely to silence the larger debate and widespread concerns about a nationwide crackdown on rights lawyers that began on July 9, 2015.\nMore than 300 lawyers have been caught up in the crackdown, which is aimed at those assisting dissidents and government critics. Most of those lawyers have been released, but 32 have been indicted and seven others are awaiting trial.\nOn Friday, Wang Qiaoling, the wife of prominent rights lawyer Li Heping, and other supporters filed a suit with the Supreme Court demanding an investigation into the police\u2019s torture of Li as well as information surrounding the disappearance of another lawyer, Wang Quanzhang.\nAfter a 669-day detention, Li returned home earlier this week after being convicted of state subversion late last month and sentenced to three years in prison with a four-year reprieve. Li\u2019s wife insists he suffered cruel torture and urged authorities to get to the bottom of the alleged abuse of power.\nMeanwhile, the Washington D.C.-based Congressional-Executive Commission on China has expressed alarm about what it called China\u2019s continued assault against rights lawyers.\n\u201cIf China persists in viewing its own citizens with suspicion and hostility and if it continues to ruthlessly disregard their most basic rights, it will never be viewed as a responsible global stakeholder,\u201d the commission said in a statement.\n\u201cThe international community needs to acknowledge that Xi Jinping\u2019s increasingly severe suppression of internationally-recognized civil and political right has real implications for regional stability and bilateral cooperation,\u201d it added.\nBrian Kopczynski contributed to this report\n\n            ",

In either case, survival involves climbing into a spherical aluminum pod, and buckling in for what is sure to be the ride of your life.\nJeanne Johnson is the first U.S. buyer of this technology. She just recently moved from the Seattle area to what she calls her \"dream home\" at the beach. It's about midway up the sandy, flat Long Beach Peninsula in southwest Washington state, and, she recognized, in a tsunami zone.\nSurvival Capsule customer Jeanne Johnson (right) lives three houses in from the dunes and the Pacific Ocean surf on Washington state's Long Beach Peninsula.\nGeologic records show the Cascadia earthquake fault offshore is capable of and has a history of generating massive tsunamis. In an effort to protect its residents, the city of Long Beach is using grant money to design an armored, man-made hill that could be used as a tsunami evacuation platform for at least 850 people.\nEvacuation options\nBut Johnson doesn't think that would work for her. While she could make a run for high ground, the Microsoft executive doubts she could reach safety in the short time between the end of the shaking of a great earthquake and incoming tsunami waves.\n\"When I decided to move to the ocean into a tsunami zone I felt like I should prepare. People panic and I don't want to be caught in the panic,\" she explained.\nSo she did a bit of Internet research and discovered a different option: a bright orange, high-strength floating metal ball that looks like something NASA had designed for astronauts. She has taken delivery and is now deciding whether to tether her capsule in her herb garden or keep it in the garage.\nThe capsule's seats have shoulder harnesses and seat belts to buckle in tight.\nThe aircraft-grade aluminum sphere is about one and a third meters in diameter. It has a round marine door and two tiny portholes. Inside, air supply tanks and about six to seven days' worth of drinking water come standard. A small portable toilet is an optional feature.\n\"My model is big enough for two people to be buckled in like a pilot's seat,\" she said, adding that she wants her dog Trixie to join her if and when \u201cthe Big One\u201d comes. \"I have friends who say, 'Oh my God, wouldn't it be claustrophobic? How can you stand it?' All I can think is, what's my option? To drown? I would rather be in that ball for the ride of my life and maintain my life.\"\nA brainstorm for survival\nThat \u2018ball\u2019 is the creation of a startup called Survival Capsule, based near Seattle. Company president Julian Sharpe is an aerospace engineer. He got the idea for the product lying awake one night while spending the weekend at a beach town in Oregon.\n\"I thought, 'Well, what happens now if a tsunami comes?'\" he recalled. \"I just thought it's going to be a disaster because I've got four sleeping kids. If it comes at night, the lights are going to be out. You don't necessarily know where you're going. You can't see the wave, how far it is. So I thought it would be great if I could design something to throw the family in and ride it out. That's where it all started.\"\nSurvival Capsule President Julian Sharpe gives some tips to his first U.S. customer, Jeanne Johnson.\nWhile the inspiration for the product was tsunami survival, Sharpe said his company's capsules are now drawing additional interest from people worried about hurricanes or typhoons.\n\"Rather than evacuate from hurricanes and be 200 miles away while the hurricane decides it wants to go in a different direction, leaving their home vulnerable - or business vulnerable - to looting, they want to stay at home and have a tsunami capsule as a last line of defense.\"\nThe cost of peace of mind\nThe two-person survival capsule starts at $13,500. A four-person model lists for $17,500. The company's initial sales have been to Japanese customers - eight capsule kits so far. Sharpe anticipates local governments in Japan could become a major customer base, although the company has two competitors in that market who are offering similar-looking survival pods. Survival Capsule has also held initial talks to license its design for fabrication in Indonesia, which might produce a lower cost for customers in developing nations.\n\n            ",

Authorities had earlier worried the storm could hit the city and cause major problems.\n\"It seems Auckland has largely survived ... unscathed,\" tweeted Auckland Mayor Phil Goff.\nCivil defense authorities said people from about 250 homes in the beach town of Ohope were told they had to evacuate, while other households chose to leave. Authorities had earlier advised people in low elevations on the Coromandel Peninsula to evacuate to higher ground, as large waves were expected to batter the coast.\nAir New Zealand suspended flights from Tauranga Airport and other flights around the country were also delayed or canceled. The military said it had placed 500 troops on standby. The storm also caused power disruptions to hundreds of homes in Whakatane and Tauranga.\nSarah Stuart-Black, director of the Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management, said the storm was \"extremely serious\" and severe weather warnings were in place for much of the country.\n\"We are watching very carefully, we're not through this yet,'' she said on Thursday evening.\nThe storm was expected to move south overnight Thursday and reach the capital, Wellington, early Friday, causing more problems along the way but also losing some of its punch.\nThe MetService weather agency predicted rainfall could exceed 100 millimeters (4 inches) in some places and cause more flooding in areas still recovering from heavy rainfall last week.\nLast Thursday the town of Edgecumbe was flooded when a river burst through a concrete levee on the Rangitaiki River as the remnants of Cyclone Debbie hit. The water forced 2,000 people to evacuate and flooded hundreds of homes.\nMany people have been unable to return to their homes since then and authorities have been scrambling to shore up the breached levee. That system and others will be tested again by rainfall from the latest storm.\nMetService predicted winds from the storm could gust to 150 kilometers (93 miles) per hour and that waves could rise to over 5 meters (16 feet).\n\n            ",

The death toll may rise as some soldiers are said to be in critical condition.\nGeneral Mohammad Radmanesh, spokesperson of the Afghan Ministry of Defense, confirmed that the attackers faked a wounded soldier scenario to get inside the base.\nCoffins containing the bodies of Afghan national Army (ANA) soldiers killed April 21 in an attack on an army headquarters are lined up in Mazar-i-Sharif, northern Afghanistan, April 22, 2017.\n\u201cWe are soldiers and we have emotions towards our fellow comrades. The soldier was covered in blood,\u201d Radmanesh said, referring to how the wounded soldier scenario has led to the loosening of security protocol.\n\u201cTwo of the assailants were suicide bombers, and the remaining eight others were armed with guns and went on a rampage to kill unarmed soldiers before they were gunned down by Afghan commandos inside the base,\u201d Radmanesh added.\nSurvivors\u2019 accounts\nZabiullah, a wounded officer from eastern Nangarhar province, told Afghan media that they were confused about who was fighting whom inside the military base as the assailants were all in Army uniform.\n\u201cAs we came out of the mosque, we heard gun shots and we saw a Ranger coming towards us at a very fast speed. There were four people in it - two in the front and two in the back seat. The two in the front seat were armed and the other two had suicide vests.\u201d Zabiullah told Ariana News, a local TV station in Afghanistan.\n\u201cOne of my colleagues said they were Afghan army soldiers as they were dressed in military uniforms. But as we were trying to figure out who they were and what to do, they started firing at us,\u201d he added.\nZabiullah said it is impossible to get inside the military base without proper identification.\n\u201cEven soldiers are not allowed in without presenting their identification cards. How were they [assailants] able to get in?\u201d Zabiullah asked.\nIn Afghanistan, the Taliban released to the media this picture, which it said shows the suicide bombers who attacked the army base in Mazar-i-Sharif, April 21, 2017.\nNoorullah, another wounded soldier, accused the senior leadership at the base of mismanagement and corruption.\n\u201cAll our seniors at the Corps are corrupt. They sell us off and they never stay in the base,\u201d he said while talking to Tolo News, a local TV Channel. \u201cWhen a poor soldier wants to visit his ailing mother during a weekend, he is not allowed to do so, but senior officials regularly use government vehicles for personal business.\u201d\n\u201cThose who helped them and gave them our guns must be hanged in public. They are using our guns against us,\u201d Mohammad Zabih, another wounded soldier from Nangarhar told Radio Liberty. \nRadmanesh told VOA an investigation is underway.\n\u201cWe have sent a high level investigation team to the base and they will investigate every aspect of the attack,\u201d Radmanesh said. \u201cThis sophisticated attack has been planned and executed with help of intelligence agencies of regional countries.\u201d\nSome security analysts, however, charge that militant groups, whether they are the Taliban or Islamic State, have previously engaged in similar attacks and security forces have failed to adapt to them.\n\u201cThe Taliban used the same tactics they used for attacking the military hospital in Kabul last month, Abdul Wahed Taqat, a retired Afghan general said. \u201cAs was the case in the attack on the hospital, the militants had deployed infiltrators inside the base in Mazar as well. They had 5-6 infiltrators in the base.\u201d\nLast month\u2019s attack on the military hospital in Kabul was claimed by Islamic State, but Taqat believes IS and the Taliban have the same foreign support.\nTaqat warned that the militants have infiltrated every sector of the Afghan security structure.\n\u201cIt must be thoroughly probed. The enemy has infiltrators in almost all security departments including army corps, national security, and they are used when needed,\u201d he added.\nWahid Muzhda, a Kabul-based Taliban expert echoes some of Taqat\u2019s concerns.\n\u201cThe militants plan such attacks with a high degree of sophistication. They use information they receive from infiltrators in planning their attacks,\u201d said Muzhda. \"The timing of the attack on the army base was based on the information provided by four of the attackers who had previously worked inside the base and had a good knowledge of how the base operated. They knew that the Friday prayer would be concluded around 1:30 p.m. and the soldiers would not be carrying guns.\"\nBut spokesperson Radmanesh downplayed the allegations of infiltration and charged that the attack happened because militants faked a wounded soldier scenario.\nVOA Afghan Service\u2019s Mirwais Bezhan contributed to this report from Mazar-i-Sharif\n\n            ",

But education experts note significant challenges such as its high implementation costs, while some criticized it for failing to consult civil society and ethnic minority education providers.\nMore than three years in the making with ample assistance from international donors and education consultants, the plan was presented in late February by de facto government leader and State Councilor Aung San Suu Kyi, who stressed it is pivotal for Myanmar's socio-economic development.\n\"The change must be started in education,\" she said. \"We all need to consider what the main needs are to succeed after the National Education Strategic Plan has been adopted.\"\nBertrand Bainvel, UNICEF's Myanmar representative, said the launch was \"a historic moment\" for the education system.\nExpensive reforms\nMyanmar's education system was one of Asia's best until the military took over in 1962. It drastically cut spending, began to emphasize rote learning and - fearing the student movements - all but dismantled higher education.\nIn 2011, the previous, quasi-civilian government began to sharply raise education spending, which was Asia's lowest and represented only 0.7 percent of GDP. It drafted a National Education Law and began developing the NESP.\nFILE - Student activists called for higher education reforms during a protest in downtown Yangon, Myanmar, Feb. 2015.\nFor the National League for Democracy government to now implement the new plan, which officially runs from 2016-2021, will be expensive. The \"low-performance scenario\" in which 80 percent of the measures are introduced, requires $10.6 billion over five years, or an average of $2.1 billion annually.\nLast year, the government spent $1.13 billion on education, international donors $71 million and individual households an estimated $186 million. So the government will have to prioritize among the proposed measures and sharply increase spending, presumably together with international donors.\nMael Raynaud, a political analyst who has written about education reform, said finding necessary funding and quality personnel to implement the NESP will be a long-term challenge.\n\"[I]t took 20 years for Indonesia to be able to provide the education sector with a budget comparable to what exists in the West, or in East Asia. And obviously, it will take decades to train teachers and professors, but also\u2026 (Ministry of Education) staff,\" he said.\nNon-state educators excluded\nRaynaud, who heads the Enlightened Myanmar Research Foundation's Political Information Program, said another major issue will be \"the process through which a number of non-state providers of education are slowly integrated in the system.\"\nIn Myanmar, Buddhist monastic schools, civil society and ethnic organizations - including rebel groups - play an important role in filling a gap in education services for poor students and children in remote ethnic areas.\nStudents study at a high school run by the Kachin Independence Army in Laiza, on the Myanmar-China border.\nRebel groups have long demanded autonomy to govern ethnic areas, including the right to teach their own languages and culture. Kachin, Karen and Mon rebels maintain education departments that teach tens of thousands of students in their areas of control, but the government mostly declines to recognize their degrees.\nThein Lwin, a former NLD member and respected education expert with the National Network for Education Reform, criticized the plan for its lack of consultation with civil society and ethnic educators, in particular on the issue of how to integrate their education programs into the government system.\nHe noted that NNER - a large network of student unions, teachers unions and ethnic education NGOs - also was ignored by the Ministry of Education.\nEthnic language teaching falls short\nAccording to Thein Lwin, the Ministry of Education's ethnic language teaching programs and curricula - implemented and drafted without non-state educators - are minimal.\n\"The difficulties are that ethnic languages are taught only in evening class, not in the school hours; Myanmar reader texts are translated into ethnic languages for teaching; and [there is a] lack of teachers for ethnic languages,\" he wrote.\nThein Lwin said many countries with indigenous minorities include strong mother tongue teaching in basic education, as it can significantly reduce dropout rates, which are often high in Myanmar's ethnic regions.\nKim Jolliffe, a political researcher who studied ethnic groups' social services provision, said the NESP's \"clear strengths\" lie in emphasizing new education approaches - such as a shift to child centered and outcomes based learning - that both state and non-state educators can use to develop unified teaching methods, which eventually can help integrate the latter's programs.\nYet, he also faulted the lack of inclusion of non-state educators in the NESP. \"There were a lot of attempts over a long period by many actors to be heard and they were just blocked out.\"\n\n            ",

He also questioned the opposition's credibility.\nHailed by some in France as a pragmatic stance to advance negotiations, the comments also caused unease among the Syrian opposition, former officials and humanitarian groups.\nMacron on Wednesday appeared to try to refine his comments after speaking to Riad Hijab, head of the Riyadh-based High Negotiations Committee, which represents a group of military and political opponents at U.N.-mediated talks between Syria's warring parties in Geneva.\nIn a statement the presidency said Macron had confirmed to Hijab that France supported the HNC in the Syrian peace talks being held under UN auspices.\n\"The president assured Mr. Hijab of his will to engage fully and personally to achieve an inclusive political solution in the Geneva framework,\" the French presidency said.\nMacron's comments on June 21 echoed Russia's stance that there is no viable alternative to Assad. The French leader has sought closer co-operation with Russia and French diplomats say he wants to develop a \"spirit of trust,\" notably on Syria.\nHijab's office said that he had, in their conversation on Tuesday, reminded Macron that Assad had \"lost legitimacy after being repeatedly responsible for using chemical weapons against his own people.\"\n\"Assad\u2019s presence in office helps spread chaos, strengthens the role of terrorist organizations, creates more sectarian militias, and fuels sectarian discrimination and hatred,\" Hijab's office said in a statement.\nMacron's election victory has offered Paris an opportunity to re-examine its policy on Syria after opponents of Hollande's foreign policy considered that his stance was too intransigent and left the French government isolated.\nRussia's foreign minister will be in Paris on Thursday to discuss the conflict.\n\n            ",

Elijah Cummings, a Maryland Democrat, speak about the failure of former national security adviser Michael Flynn to disclose payments for a 2015 speech in Moscow.\nThe White House responded Tuesday by saying it didn't know whether Flynn had broken the law in the course of making contact with and receiving payments from foreign governments. \nPress secretary Sean Spicer downplayed claims that the White House had denied the request, saying the committee had received all the documents it needed from other agencies.\n\"Right now, to ask the White House to produce documents that were not in the possession of the White House is ridiculous,\" Spicer told reporters.\nAfter an hourlong classified briefing, Chaffetz said he had seen no evidence Flynn complied with the law.\nRepresentative Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the committee's ranking Democrat, said Flynn's contacts were \"a major problem.\" He added that the matter would now most likely fall under the purview of the House Intelligence Committee. \"Somebody else will determine whether or not he's guilty,\" he told reporters after the news conference. \nThe lawmakers said Flynn would have needed permission to deliver a paid speech at a gala sponsored by the Russian-funded television station RT in 2015, where he sat at the same table with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Flynn received $45,000 for that appearance and more than $500,000 for lobbying on behalf of the Turkish government.\nCummings and Chaffetz said it appeared Flynn did not seek or receive the required permission and could be prosecuted for failing to do so.\n\"The statute's real clear. You have to seek and get permission,\" Chaffetz told reporters after the briefing. \"It's a pretty high bar.

Marc Short, Trump's director of legislative affairs, said the White House did not hold material predating Flynn's service as national security adviser.\nAsked whether Flynn had violated federal law, Spicer told reporters Tuesday, \"That would be a question for him. I don't know what he filled out,\" referring to Flynn's responses to questions on federal security documents.\nFlynn was forced to leave the White House after lying to Vice President Mike Pence about his conversations with Russian Ambassador to U.S. Sergey Kislyak during the period before Trump officially took office.\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said the newest Flynn allegations were \"extremely troubling\" and called for an investigation into the matter.\nFILE - Then-Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates speaks during a news conference at the Justice Department in Washington, June 28, 2016.\nYates, Clapper to testify at hearing \nMeanwhile, the Senate Judiciary Committee announced Tuesday that former acting Attorney General Sally Yates and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper would testify at a May 8 hearing on Russia's meddling in last year's U.S. presidential election.\nYates and Clapper are also expected to testify at a public House intelligence panel hearing sometime after May 2, the date FBI Director James Comey is scheduled to appear before the committee in a closed session.\nLast month, Comey acknowledged that his agency was investigating whether members of Trump's campaign had colluded with Russia to try to influence the election.

Turks also gave the United States considerably higher marks for schools and business opportunities than interracial harmony, protection of human rights or efforts to fight international crime.\nOnly 12.4 percent of the respondents said they felt very favorably about America, with 29.8 percent saying they felt somewhat favorably. Another 33 percent viewed the United States very unfavorably and 14 percent ranked it somewhat unfavorably. Just under 12 percent said they didn't know or refused to answer.\nThe survey was conducted last year but publicly released only Wednesday, hours after President Donald Trump held his first telephone call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Turkish presidential sources said the two leaders agreed to cooperate in the fight against Islamic State extremists in Syria, and that CIA Director Mike Pompeo would soon visit Turkey.\nGallup survey results.\nIn the Gallup survey, Russia ranked even worse than the United States, with 44.1 seeing it very unfavorably \u2014 up from 33 percent three years earlier \u2014 and 18 percent viewing it \"somewhat unfavorably\" amid tensions over Moscow's involvement in Syria and Turkey's downing of a Russian fighter jet that violated its airspace in November 2015.\nThe poll of 1,700 Turkish adults and 500 Kurdish speakers was conducted May 12-June 19, before an attempted coup by Turkey's army on July 15.

Everything which has been said in the media about this subject is totally untrue,\" Assad's statement read.\nFILE - Syria's President Bashar al-Assad speaks to French journalists in Damascus, Syria, Jan. 9, 2017.\nThis week, the Assad government toned down its objections \u2014 at least in public \u2014 when Russian negotiators at the Astana talks handed to rebel counterparts a version of the draft constitution. In private, within the talks process, the government has raised reservations. The difference speaks volumes, say Middle East analysts, arguing that it reflects how Russia is now calling the shots when it comes to finding a solution to the long-running conflict in Syria.\nRussia fills gap\nThis week, Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May told U.S. Republicans in a speech that neither her country nor America should invade foreign countries \"to make the world in their own image.\" Russia appears determined to fill the gap and model post-conflict Syria according to its vision.\nLast week, Russia signed a long-term military agreement with Syria allowing it to expand its Tartus naval base. A similar agreement allows the expansion of the Russian-built Khmeimim air base in Latakia.\nSyrian rebels have noted the contrast between what they see as a retreating West and a newly assertive Moscow, dubbing Russia \"imperialist.\" Rebel negotiators have rejected Russia's draft constitution, telling Moscow that only Syrians are entitled to write their country's constitution. However, some rebel leaders concede privately that their weakness on the battlefield thanks to Russian hard power and a developing rapprochement between Moscow and Turkey, their biggest overseas backer, is placing them in an increasingly weak position.\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, left, shakes hands with Syria's opposition members in Moscow, Russia, Jan. 27, 2017.\nSpeaking Friday in Moscow, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov stressed the importance of the Russian draft constitution for a future Syria.\n\"The draft constitution attempts to bring together and find shared points in those approaches that were outlined to us both by representatives of the government and representatives of the opposition, including all those present here, over the past several years,\" Lavrov said.\nHe emphasized Russia does not want to impose it on the country. The rebels, however, aren't so sure. They say that, at the very least, Russia is trying to pre-define much of what will be discussed when it comes to U.N.-brokered peace talks expected to resume next month. \nSyrian opposition figure Yahya al-Aridi says Russia's Syria envoy, Alexander Lavrentiev, presented the rebel delegation with the draft constitution at the start of the Astana talks this week. \nLeft on the table\nAt first, the rebel negotiators left the document on the table, a gesture of disregard and in line with their insistence that they only agreed to attend the Russian-brokered negotiations to discuss the fragile cease-fire and boosting humanitarian aid into their war-torn country.\nYahya Al-Aridi, spokesman for the Syrian opposition, speaks to the media ahead of the Syria peace talks in Astana, Kazakhstan, Jan. 24, 2017.\nTheir biggest priority all week has been to get Iranian-controlled militias to abide by the cease-fire brokered by Russia and Turkey.\nAs far as the rebels are concerned, the draft constitution merely shakes up existing government power structures, a reformulation as they see it of the existing Baath party's state structures. The draft goes further: curbing presidential powers, adjusting the parliamentary structure, and introducing changes to the judiciary and the security agencies.\nAnd to the frustration of Syrian Kurds, who welcome the proposed dropping of Arab in the name of the country, the Russian constitution falls short of political federalism, although it envisages Kurds being given greater administrative freedoms in northeast Syria. The ruling Kurdish PYD in northern Syria attended a Moscow meeting Friday. The PYD was not invited to the Astana talks because of Turkish objections \u2014 Ankara views the group as a terrorist organization with ties to Turkey's outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK).\nRussia's state-owned news agency, Sputnik News, reported in June 2016 that Russia suggested the name change for the country \"in order to appeal to ethnic minorities such as Kurds and Turkmen.\" Pre-war Syria had a 74 percent majority Arab population; 9 percent were Kurds, and there were about 100,000 Turkmen.\nBefore he took office on January 20, U.S. President Donald Trump indicated he will cede efforts to end the Syrian civil war to the Russians, and suggested he might end American financial and logistical support for rebel forces battling Assad.\nThe Syrian president has clung to power thanks to the intervention of allies Russia and Iran. And they appear now to be securing rewards. Earlier this month, the Syrian government announced it would give Iran 5,000 hectares of land for farming, and 1,000 hectares for oil and gas terminals. Iran also has secured electricity projects.\n\n            ",

That footage, which now appears to depict the second of two visits to the Ferguson Market and Liquor store by Brown within a span of a few hours, showed Brown pushing a worker before walking out with cigarillos in an apparent robbery.\nBrown's family and protesters had criticized the release of the video as an effort to demonize the teenager.\nWitnesses have given conflicting accounts of Brown's encounter a short time later with police officer Darren Wilson.\nLocal and federal investigations cleared Wilson of criminal wrongdoing.\nThe new video, which appears in the documentary \"Stranger Fruit,\" shows Brown in an earlier, seemingly more amicable exchange.\nIt shows him giving store employees what appears to be a small bag, the contents of which the staff pass around and sniff. One employee gives Brown two boxes of cigarillos in a carrier bag.\nBrown takes a few steps away before turning back and handing the bag back to an employee who appears to stash it behind the counter.\nJason Pollock, the documentary filmmaker, said the video showed Brown exchanging marijuana for cigarillos and undermined the police account that Brown may have robbed the store.\n\"He left his items at the store and he went back the next day to pick them up,\" Pollock says in the documentary. \"Mike did not rob the store.\"\n'No Transaction'\nRobert McCulloch, the St. Louis County prosecuting attorney, dismissed Pollock's account as \"pathetic.\"\n\"There was no transaction. There was certainly an attempt to barter for these goods, but the store employees had no involvement at all in that,\" McCulloch told a news conference on Monday. The clerks did nothing wrong, he added, and were not safeguarding the cigarillos for Brown.\nMcCulloch said he would release unedited video from the store showing that the clerks replaced the items returned by Brown, which he said undermined the idea there had been any trade.\nJay Kanzler, a lawyer for the convenience store, also disputed the filmmaker's explanation.\n\"The reason he gave it back is he was walking out the door with unpaid merchandise and they wanted it back,\" Kanzler was quoted as saying by the New York Times. He did not respond to a request for comment.\nAbout 100 protesters, who saw the video as exonerating Brown, gathered on Sunday night at the store, which was protected by a couple of hundred police officers.\nThe protest was largely peaceful, although police arrested at least two people, a Reuters witness said, and an unknown person fired about half a dozen bullets into the air toward the end of the demonstration.\n\n            ",

It is mandated by the U.N. Security Council to identify individuals and organizations responsible for chemical attacks in Syria.\nChemical weapons use a war crime\nVirginia Gamba, the head of the Joint Investigative Mechanism, denied any list of individual suspects had yet been compiled by the inquiry.\n\u201cThere are no ... identification of individuals being considered at this time,\u201d she told Reuters by email.\nThe use of chemical weapons is banned under international law and could constitute a war crime.\nWhile the inquiry has no judicial powers, any naming of suspects could lead to their prosecution. Syria is not a member of the International Criminal Court (ICC), but alleged war crimes could be referred to the court by the Security Council \u2014 although splits among global powers over the war make this a distant prospect at present.\n\u201cThe ICC is concerned about any country where crimes are reported to be committed,\u201d a spokesman for the court said when asked for comment. \u201cUnless Syria accepts the ICC jurisdiction, the only way that [the] ICC would have jurisdiction over the situation would be through a referral by the Security Council.\u201d\nThe list seen by Reuters could form the basis for the inquiry team's investigations this year, according to the source. It is unclear whether the United Nations or OPCW will publish the list separately.\nA U.N. chemical weapons expert, wearing a gas mask, holds a plastic bag containing samples from one of the sites of an alleged chemical weapons attack in the Ain Tarma neighborhood of Damascus, Syria, Aug. 29, 2013.\n'Highest levels'\nThe list identifies 15 people \u201cto be scrutinized in relation to use of CW [chemical weapons] by Syrian Arab Republic Armed Forces in 2014 and 2015.\u201d It does not specify what role they are suspected of playing, but lists their titles.\nIt is split into three sections. The first, titled \u201cInner Circle President\u201d lists six people including Assad; his brother, who commands the elite 4th Armored Division; the defense minister; and the head of military intelligence.\nThe second section names the air force chief as well as four commanders of air force divisions. They include the heads of the 22nd Air Force Division and the 63rd Helicopter Brigade, units that the inquiry has previously said dropped chlorine bombs.\nThe third part of the list \u2014 \u201cOther relevant Senior Mil Personnel\u201d \u2014 names two colonels and two major generals.\nHamish de Bretton-Gordon, an independent specialist in biological and chemical weapons who monitors Syria, told Reuters the list reflected the military chain of command.\n\u201cThe decisions would be made at the highest levels initially and then delegated down. Hence the first use would need to be authorized by Assad,\u201d said de Bretton-Gordon, a former commander of British and NATO chemical and biological defense divisions who frequently visits Syria for professional consultancy work.\nThe Syrian defense ministry and air force could not be reached for comment.\nChlorine barrel bombs\nSyria joined the international Chemical Weapons Convention under a U.S.-Russian deal that followed the deaths of hundreds of civilians in a sarin gas attack in Ghouta on the outskirts of Damascus in August 2013.\nIt was the deadliest use of chemicals in global warfare since the 1988 Halabja massacre at the end of the Iran-Iraq War, which killed at least 5,000 people in Iraqi Kurdistan.\nThe Syrian government, which denied its forces were behind the Ghouta attack, also agreed to hand over its declared stockpile of 1,300 tonnes of toxic weaponry and dismantle its chemical weapons program under international supervision.\nThe United Nations and OPCW have been investigating whether Damascus is adhering to its commitments under the agreement, which averted the threat of U.S.-led military intervention.\nThe bodies appointed the panel of experts to conduct the inquiry, and its mandate runs until November. The panel published a report in October last year that said Syrian government forces used chemical weapons at least three times in 2014-15 and that Islamic State used mustard gas in 2015.\nThe October report identified Syria's 22nd Air Force Division and 63rd Helicopter Brigade as having dropped chlorine bombs and said people \u201cwith effective control in the military units ... must be held accountable.\u201d\nThe source familiar with the inquiry said the October report had clearly established the institutions responsible and that the next step was to go after the individuals.\nWomen, affected by what activists say was a gas attack, receive treatment inside a makeshift hospital in Kfar Zeita village in the central province of Hama, Syria, May 22, 2014.\n18 Syrian officials blacklisted\nWashington on Thursday blacklisted 18 senior Syrian officials based on the U.N.-OPCW inquiry's October report \u2014 some of whom also appear on the list seen by Reuters \u2014 but not Assad or his brother.\nThe issue of chemical weapons use in Syria has become a deeply political one, and the U.N.-OPCW inquiry's allegations of chlorine bomb attacks by government forces have split the U.N. Security Council's veto-wielding members.\nThe United States, Britain and France have called for sanctions against Syria, while Assad's ally Russia has said the evidence presented is insufficient to justify such measures.\nA Security Council resolution would be required to bring Assad and other senior Syrian officials before the International Criminal Court for any possible war crimes prosecution \u2014 something Russia would most likely block.\n\n            ",

The others are Water Resources minister, Uma Bharti, and senior leaders Murli Manohar Joshi and Kalyan Singh.\nThese BJP leaders have repeatedly said that the demolition of the mosque in 1992 was a spontaneous act by an angry mob which descended on the small, sleepy Aydohya town in 1992 and tore down the mosque with pickaxes, crowbars and even their bare hands.\nIndia's Prime Minister Narendra Modi addresses his supporters at Bharatiya Janata Party headquarters in New Delhi, India, March 12, 2017.\nReligious site with a disputed history\nHindu groups believe that the mosque was built after the destruction of a temple dedicated to Lord Rama, which used to stand on what they say is the birthplace of their revered god.\nThe issue continues to be an emotive and polarizing one as Hindus want to build a grand temple on the site while Muslims want a new mosque.\nThe bitter dispute has been winding its ways through courts for decades.\nBJP leaders insist there was no conspiracy\nAfter Wednesday's court order, Bharti, who is now the Water Resources Minister, told reporters that there had been no conspiracy to bring down the mosque. Asserting that she had no regrets and that it was her dream to see the temple built, she said \u201cI want to tell the country it's time for the Ram temple to be built.\u201d\nAs it campaigned for elections in Uttar Pradesh state, where it scored a huge victory in recent elections, the BJP promised that rebuilding the temple \u201cwithin the framework of the constitution\u201d remains a priority.\nHowever, independent political analyst Ajoy Bose said it could be embarrassing now for the government to openly sponsor the temple's construction.\nBuilding a Hindu temple on site is still strong issue\n\u201cThere were indeed in Uttar Pradesh plans of starting the Ram mandir movement, so resurrecting the whole demolition, the controversies around it, all that has a symbolic effect and after this court order BJP would be somewhat on the backfoot,\u201d said Bose.\nCritics charge that the campaign to rebuild the temple is part of a Hindu nationalist agenda that the BJP under Prime Minister Modi's watch is trying to promote. Such concerns have been heightened by last month's appointment of Yogi Adityanath, as chief minister of Uttar Pradesh. The hardline religious leader has made anti-Muslim remarks in the past and is a staunch supporter of building a temple.\nThe Supreme Court is also hearing the case with regard to ownership of the disputed land where the mosque stood. Last month, Chief Justice J.S. Kheh argued the two communities to settle their claims through negotiations and even offered to act as a mediator.\nCases usually take decades as they wind their way through India's slow-moving legal system, but the Supreme Court has ordered that the case against the BJP leaders should be concluded in two years.\n\n            ",

Many African-Americans objected to her comment during Senate confirmation hearings that historically black colleges were the \"real pioneers when it comes to school choice\" \u2014 a reference to her belief that parents and students in the American system of public education should be able to choose between state-run elementary and secondary schools and alternative schools sponsored by churches or other nonpublic groups supported by public funds.\nA protester is escorted out of commencement exercises during a speech by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos at Bethune-Cookman University in Daytona Beach, Florida, May 10, 2017.\nAfrican-American educators and students said DeVos' views were misdirected, because historically black colleges and universities, known as HBCUs, became established as a response to systems of racial segregation widely practiced in the United States during the first half of the 20th century and earlier.\nThe HBCUs, protesters said, were \"born not out of mere choice, but out of necessity, in the face of racism.''\nJackson, Bethune-Cookman's president, had been accused of selling out the school by offering DeVos an honorary doctoral degree and inviting her to address the student body.\nProtesters delivered a petition signed by thousands of people urging the university to revoke the invitation to the education secretary, but Jackson refused.\n\n            ",

They recorded 361 cases compared to 410 in 2015, which had already been the lowest number in a decade. The figure reported Sunday is the lowest since 2003, when 360 incidents were recorded.\nThe report attributed much of the drop to increased security measures in European countries including France, where there were 15 attacks compared to 72 in the previous year, and the United Kingdom, where the number of incidents fell from 62 to 43.\nAnother reason for the decreased violence may be that far-right groups in Europe appear to be focusing their attacks on migrants who have reached the continent in large numbers over the last years, said Dina Porat, a historian who leads the team of researchers behind the report.\n\"Fears that the influx of Muslim refugees from the Middle East would lead to an increase in anti-Semitism appear so far to have been unjustified,\" Porat said.While Islamic extremists are often involved in attacks on Jews, the perpetrators are usually second or third generation immigrants who have been radicalized at home in Europe or during trips to territories held by the Islamic State group, she said.\nTel Aviv University's Center for the Study of Contemporary European Jewry releases the report every year on the eve of Israel's Holocaust memorial day, which begins Sunday at sundown.\nAccording to the report, the reduced violence was not mirrored by a drop in cases of general anti-Semitism, which increased in countries including the United Kingdom, Germany and the United States.\n\"There is a dramatic rise in all forms of verbal and visual anti-Semitism, harassment and insults, mainly on the internet, but also offline,\" Porat said.\nOn U.S. university campuses there was a 45 percent rise in anti-Semitic incidents, mostly insults and harassment of Jewish students, the report said. Porat said these were usually connected to increased anti-Israel activities by pro-Palestinian groups on campus.\nThe number of violent anti-Semitic incidents in the United States was largely stable compared to 2015, rising slightly from 88 to 91. While the report dealt only with cases until the end of 2016, Porat said there were no indications so far of a major increase connected to the tense U.S. election or Donald Trump's new presidency.\nJewish leaders who commented on the report praised the increased security measures credited with reducing violence, but said this may be masking a trend of anti-Semitism becoming more mainstream and acceptable, especially on the far left and right of European politics.\n\"We see a dramatic growth in the number of parliamentarians who allow themselves to express anti-Semitic views,\" said Moshe Kantor, president of the European Jewish Congress, an umbrella group representing Jewish communities across the continent.\nIn an interview with The Associated Press, Kantor cited the controversy over anti-Jewish remarks made by some members of Britain's Labour Party, the close defeat of the far-right candidate in last year's Austrian presidential election and the strong polling of National Front leader Marine Le Pen ahead of Sunday's vote in France.\n\"We are very, very close today to a situation in which anti-Semites will come to executive power,\" he said.\n\n            ",

Last year, Taliban militants came close to capturing the city again before Afghan forces pushed them back.\nThe Taliban reportedly has recently amassed fighters in Kunduz's Imam Saheb district, bordering Tajikistan.\n\u201cThe Taliban has about 650 fighters, most of whom are local residents, in the district and they have been deployed in 45 groups,\u201d district governor Imamuddin Quraishi told VOA.\nAccording to Quraishi, Taliban fighters are equipped with heavy weapons, and they train in areas along the border with Tajikistan.\n\u201cThey [Taliban] control the Zangla area near the Tajikistan border where they train terrorists,\u201d said Quraishi.\nLocal Taliban leaders in Kunduz reportedly have met with Russian advisors across the Amu River in Tajikistan, according to Afghan media reports.\nTaliban's connections with Russia came under the spotlight last year as Moscow sought to increase its influence in the nation it once occupied, and to counter IS expansion from Afghanistan to neighboring Central Asian countries.\nRussia has acknowledged ties with the Taliban as it views Taliban help as essential in fighting the spillover effects of the IS insurgency in Afghanistan.\nRussian officials say Moscow is not supplying Taliban militants with arms and training, though, asserting their contacts with the Taliban are aimed at diplomatically facilitating the peace process in Afghanistan.\nFILE - Army Gen.

Such an involvement on Russia's part, they say, could complicate an already precarious security situation in the country.\n\u201cI believe what Russia is attempting to do is they are attempting to be an influential party in this part of the world,\u201d U.S. Central Command chief Gen. Joseph Votel told House lawmakers on Wednesday.\n\u201cI think it is fair to assume they may be providing some sort of support to [the Taliban], in terms of weapons or other things that may be there,\u201d Votel said.\nAccording to Wahid Muzhda, a Kabul-based Taliban expert, Moscow has provided the Taliban with a well-equipped mobile clinic, along with a large supply of medicine to treat injured Taliban fighters in the southern Helmand province, where Afghan forces are engaged in heavy battles with Taliban.\nA Taliban delegation from its political office in Qatar recently told officials in Moscow the Taliban wanted anti-aircraft missiles, according to Muzhda.\nAs Moscow's concerns grow that IS is expanding to Central Asia, Taliban is a willing ally, Muzhda said.\n\u201cTaliban have been fighting IS in Afghanistan and that has brought the group closer to Russia,\u201d said Muzhda. \u201cThe Taliban have killed several IS-linked, anti-Russia Uzbek fighters in Afghanistan.\u201d\nWhile opposed to Taliban insurgency \u2014 Taliban controls some 33 of the country's 407 districts \u2014 Kabul and the U.S. reject notions that Taliban are fighting IS in Afghanistan.\n\u201cThis idea that Taliban and Daesh [IS] are opposed to each other is wrong,\u201d Afghanistan national security advisor Mohammad Hanif Atmar told Indian media this month. \u201cIt's actually the morphing and mutating of Taliban \u2026 into Daesh.

As angry farmers dumped milk and vegetables on the streets in India\u2019s western Maharashtra state and six farmers were killed by police in Madhya Pradesh state when they blocked roads and burnt vehicles, the spotlight has turned on growing rural distress in the country.\nA truck burns during a farmers protest on a highway near Bhopal in the central state of Madhya Pradesh, India, June 9, 2017.\nThe protests flared unexpectedly when bumper harvests following a good monsoon were supposed to augur well for rural prosperity.\nBut the opposite has happened: a price crash due to the crop glut not just wiped away any prospect of a profit but left farmers struggling to pay back loans which they often raise to buy seeds, fertilizers and other inputs to plant crops.\nLow crop prices\nThe violence witnessed last week was a rare eruption of anger in the rural community in a country whose economy is the world\u2019s fastest-growing, but where tens of millions of farmers are coping with stagnating incomes as they struggle to make a living off small land holdings.\nExperts say decades of neglect in crucial infrastructure in the farm sector has left behind India\u2019s countryside. With no easy access to markets close to villages and few storage facilities, farmers say they are at the mercy of traders and middlemen who often do not give them a fair price for their produce.\n\u201cThe farmer does not have the right to set the price. It is the middlemen who set the price. They buy my produce for Rs 10 per kilo and sell it for Rs. 20 or 30 to customers. This is a major problem in the country,\u201d lamented Bhim Singh, a farmer in northern India. \u201cThere should be better marketing platforms for us.\u201d\nOnce a week, he makes an 80 kilometer trip to Gurugram, a flourishing business hub near the capital New Delhi, where he sells directly to consumers to get a better price. But he says he is forced to dump the rest in a wholesale market for prices that barely cover his cost of cultivation.\nMany farmers Haryana state travel to this market in the business hub of Gurugram near New Delhi to get a better price for his produce for which they say they otherwise get a poor price.\nFarmers always seem to suffer\n\u201cThere is a strong pro-consumer bias in the system,\u201d said agriculture economist Ashok Gulati at the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations in New Delhi. \u201cWhen there is a drought, as there was in 2014 and 2015, farmers suffer as production drops, and when there is a good harvest they suffer again as prices crash in the absence of commensurate storage and processing facilities or due to export restrictions.\u201d\nRural experts have long urged the government to build more roads and markets closer to villages and storage facilities that will make it possible for them to sell produce at better prices when there is a bumper crop instead of resorting to distress sales as has happened this year.\nBetter roads and storage facilities needed\nIn fact, although food production has increased steadily in India making it self-sufficient, farmers incomes have lagged behind. New Delhi based agriculture expert Devender Sharma pointed out the average income of a farmer in 17 states, as per the government\u2019s 2016 economic survey, is a meager Rs. 20,000 (about $300) per year.\n\u201cThe real income of farmers is static for last 25 years. There is something terribly, terribly going wrong\u2026 he requirement is overhaul of agriculture policies. We need to give farmers his due income,\u201d he points out.\nToo many farmers\nThe low incomes are not surprising \u2014 too many people depend on agriculture for a living. Farming accounts for just 15 per cent of the country\u2019s gross domestic product, but it supports more than half the country\u2019s 1.3 billion people.\nBumper harvests after good rains did not bring good news for farmers as the crop glut led to a price crash.\nIn a cover story this month, a leading news magazine, India Today, called India \u201cNo country for Farmers\u201d and said the country \u201cdesperately needs another revolution in agriculture for the farmer to break out of his vicious cycle of misery.\u201d\nReports of farmers committing suicide because they cannot repay their loans come in with alarming regularity.\nFarmer Bhim Singh testified to the sense of despondency in his community. \u201cMy children don\u2019t want to go into farming. They say they will toil as labor, work in factories, but they will not farm.\u201d\nState takes action after protests\nIn the wake of protests by farmers in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, the state governments have promised to write off bank loans and ensure farmers get better prices for their crops. In the northern Uttar Pradesh state, where elections were held earlier this year, the government has also promised to write off loans.\nBut this has triggered even greater anger among farmers in the rest of the country, said chief adviser to the Consortium of Indian Farmers Association, P. Chengal Reddy.\nDisappointment with new prime minister\nHe said farmers had pinned high hopes on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who had promised to address their problems when he was voted to office three years ago and has pledged to double farm incomes by 2022.\nBut farmers feel let down because on the ground nothing has changed. And the crash in prices of farm produce this year was for many he says \u201cthe last straw.\u201d\n\u201cThe dichotomy of India is that Indian agriculture is successful but farmers are angry, annoyed, disgusted, unhappy,\u201d Reddy warned. \u201cThis [dumping of] vegetables and milk is only a beginning.\u201d\n\n            ",

They pointed out that she telephoned Cosby more than 50 times after the alleged attack, but told police she had no contact with him.\n\"It's not a fib. It's not a mistake, It's a stone cold lie,\" Brian McMonagle told the jury.\nConstand said the calls were just business and that Cosby, as a Temple alumnus, could help the basketball team.\n\"This isn't talking to a trustee. This is talking to a lover,\" McMonagle said, accusing Constand of trying to use Cosby's name for financial gain.\nThe prosecution relied heavily on parts of the deposition Cosby gave to police in a 2005 civil suit brought by Constand.\nIn it, Cosby admitted getting a prescription to a sedative called Quaaludes back in the 1970s and giving the drug to women he wanted to sleep with.\nDistrict Attorney Kevin Steele told the jury these words prove Cosby knew exactly what he was doing when he allegedly gave pills to Constand, telling her they were herbal relaxants.\n\"Drugging somebody and putting them in a position where you can do what you want with them is not romantic. It's criminal.\"\nSteele said no amount of \"fancy lawyering\" will save Cosby from his own words.\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, he has told you what he has done,\" Steele said to the jurors. \"It is about as straightforward as you are ever going to see in a sex crimes case.\"\nIf found guilty, Cosby could go to prison for the rest of his life.\nMore than 50 women claim Cosby sexually assaulted them in incidents dating back to the 1960s, when he emerged as a major comedy star. Most of the alleged incidents occurred too long ago to be prosecuted now.\nConstand's complaint is the only one that has come to trial. Cosby has denied all the charges.\nCosby won fame for stand-up comedy routines focusing on his Philadelphia childhood and growing up in a middle class black family.\nHe played a wise and genial doctor in his 1980s television comedy series, The Cosby Show. It was the country's most popular TV show for much of its eight-year run.\n\n            ",

The 39 dead and the dozens wounded had come to celebrate the arrival of 2017 but already, thanks to a lone gunman, this year appears set to be a bloody repeat of 2016 for Turkey.\nTerror attacks have come right on top of each other in the country in an accelerating succession of bombings and shootings.\nAn injured woman is carried to an ambulance from a nightclub where a gun attack took place during a New Year's party in Istanbul, Turkey, Jan. 1, 2017.\nLast month alone saw 44 people killed and 163 wounded in a twin bomb attack on a football stadium in Istanbul. Just 11 days ago in the country\u2019s capital, Ankara, the Russian ambassador was gunned down by an off-duty policeman who announced the slaying was in protest at Russia\u2019s indiscriminate bombing of Syrian rebels and civilians in eastern Aleppo.\nSince July 2015 more than 500 people have died in Turkey in terror attacks claimed either by the Islamic State terror group or Kurdish separatists. Eight IS members were detained last week suspected of preparing a suicide attack for New Year's Eve.\nFew security experts doubt the killing on Saturday night is somehow linked to the Islamic State terror group. While Kurdish separatists tend to target Turkish soldiers whether they are on or off duty, the only discernible pattern in who is targeted by jihadists is that there is no pattern. It is the \u2018where\u2019 that\u2019s important, say counter-terror experts.\nIN PICTURES: Istanbul Nightclub New Year's Eve Terror Attack\nIstanbul Nightclub New Year's Eve Terror Attack\nThe killing zones are crowded venues so the casualty tally has the potential to be high \u2014 the same holds true in Europe and North Africa as in Turkey.\nSad list\nIstanbul\u2019s Reina night club joins a sad list: The Tunisian resort of Sousse, where Western vacationers were slaughtered by a lone gunman who at first looked like just another beachcomber going for a stroll, kicking up some spray by the Mediterranean\u2019s edge before unleashing his mayhem.

The terror attacks are not incidents in battlefield action with bombs and bullets flying \u2014 they involve, as with the Reina nightclub slaughter, the methodical killing of unarmed victims who are often partying or relaxing and are utterly vulnerable.\nWith rare exceptions, such as the Bataclan assault, spectacular 9/11 attacks that require some ingenuity, planning and training for months even years are currently being eschewed by jihadists. What we have is the shocking targeting of the easiest, most vulnerable victims and in the least challenging circumstances for the assailants.\nFILE - People mourn in front of the screened-off facade of the Bataclan Cafe adjoining the concert hall, one of the sites of the deadly attacks in Paris, France, a day before a ceremony to pay tribute to the 130 victims, Nov. 26, 2015.\nOne of the reasons for the so-called soft targeting is that improved security and greater vigilance is making it harder for more complex terror plots to be executed, analysts say. But even improved security is not full-proof.\nEnhanced security \nIn the hours after the massacre at the Reina, one of Istanbul\u2019s best-known nightclubs, popular with locals and tourists alike and frequented by businessmen and diplomats, security analysts were questioning the ease with which the gunman was able to arrive in a taxi armed with an automatic weapon.\nSecurity had been beefed up in Istanbul for the New Year celebrations. There were 25,000 policemen on duty in Istanbul on Saturday night and the gunman\u2019s taxi passed through three nearby security checkpoints to reach the club. The gunman, after spraying bullets in the crowded club that was hosting up to 800 people, had no difficulty in making good his escape.\nA Turkish coast guard boat patrols in front of the Reina nightclub by the Bosphorus, which was attacked by a gunman, in Istanbul, Jan. 1, 2017.\nTurkish commentator Murat Yetkin questions the competence of the police and security officials who have been replacing those purged by the government in the wake of the botched coup in July to unseat President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan.\n\u201cThere have recently been a number of warnings sent to provincial governors that major terrorist attacks are expected in big cities, especially in Istanbul and Ankara, focused on crowded places like shopping malls, restaurants and nightclubs frequented by foreign nationals and tourists. If there is a failure, the precautions side of security should now be debated,\u201d he argues.\nThe attack has not only exposed possible Turkish security failings as the country experiences the mounting backlash of the conflict in neighboring Syria. It is also prompting questions about the effectiveness President Erdogan\u2019s autocratic style of governing. \u201cIn times of crisis when violence stalks the land people cry out for a strongman to get a grip on the problem. But what if terrorism spawns chaos in a country already under the thumb of a strong man?\u201d queries Mark Almond, an Oxford University historian and author of \u201cSecular Turkey: A Short History.\u201d\nSecurity challenges\n\u201cTurkey is in a uniquely awful position. It now has the strongest president since the military coup in 1980, possibly since Ataturk himself ninety years ago. But President Erdogan\u2019s extraordinary skill in consolidating his power has not been matched by an ability to solve the country\u2019s problems,\u201d Almond said.\nThose problems could worsen in the coming months as jihadists lose more territory in Syria and Iraq and vent their fury on Turkey. But it is not only Turkey that has been put on notice by Saturday\u2019s attack that 2017 will likely continue in much the same way as 2016.\nBritish security minister Ben Wallace warned hours before the Reina attack that Islamic State wants to carry out a mass casualty attack in Britain and has \u201cno moral barrier\u201d to using chemical weapons.\n\u201cThey want to harm as many people as possible and terrorize as many people as possible.They have no moral objection to using chemical weapons against populations and if they could, they would in this country,\u201d Wallace told Britain's Times newspaper, adding, \"The casualty figures which could be involved would be everybody's worst fear.\u201d\n\n            ",

The terms were reached at a meeting in the southwestern province of Guizhou. \nChina claims ownership of nearly all of the South China Sea, believed to be the source of vast oil and gas deposits, despite partial counterclaims from Taiwan and several ASEAN members. The dispute has created divisions among ASEAN members that usually try to operate by consensus.\nThe issue escalated in recent years as China followed a strategy of constructing artificial islands in the sea that can support regional military facilities.

The country's president, Gjorge Ivanov, has sided with the protesters and so far has withheld approving a coalition government that would shut out the main nationalist party.\nEuropean Union leaders and analysts say the mounting political confrontation could spin out of control, adding to increasing ethnic tensions across a destabilizing Balkans.\nA group called For a United Macedonia announced Monday that it would continue to organize mass rallies in the capital, Skopje, as well as in other towns nationwide against the formation of the coalition. The group accuses the prime minister of neighboring Albania, Edi Rama, of being the true author of the coalition idea.\nFarmers on tractors participate in a protest in front of the government building in Skopje, Macedonia, March 10, 2017. Thousands of ethnic Macedonians have held evening protests against three ethnic Albanian parties forming a coalition government with the Social Democrats.\n'People won't go home'\n\"The masks have fallen,\" Bogdan Ilievski, protest organizer and one of the group's leaders, said in a statement. \"We are in favor of a united Macedonia for all, and we are against platforms written in other countries, which some of our politicians won't clearly reject. Despite their attempts to hide their true intentions, they will be met with strong resistance from the democratic public. The people won't go home.\"\nOne of the key demands of the ethnic Albanian parties is that the Albanian language be recognized as an official second language. Ivanov has called the demands for greater recognition of ethnic Albanian rights a \"threat to Macedonia's sovereignty.\" A quarter of Macedonia's population is ethnic Albanian.\nThe standoff between the country's two ethnic groups worsened last December when the Macedonian nationalist party VMRO narrowly won parliamentary elections. The Albanian parties declined to enter a coalition government with VMRO, deciding instead to partner with the Social Democrats.\nZoran Zaev, leader of the opposition Social Democrats, presents the program of the new Macedonian government, at the party headquarters in the capital, Skopje, March 10, 2017.\nSocial Democrats say Ivanov is stirring the ethnic dispute. They argue he is using it as a distraction to withhold giving a mandate to their leader, Zoran Zaev, because Ivanov and former Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski fear the Social Democrats will open probes into illicit wiretapping and corruption allegations that have dogged the VMRO government since 2015.\n2001 agreement\nA dispute over ethnic Albanian rights appeared to have been settled more than a decade ago when in 2001 a seven-month-long ethnic Albanian insurgency that left more than 100 dead ended with an agreement providing more rights for the country's ethnic minority. Progress, though, on enacting the agreement has been slow.\n\"To avoid jail time for his friends, President Ivanov is instead inciting ethnic clashes over a nonissue such as the use of Albanian language in public institutions,'\" said Gjovalin Shkurtaj, a member of the National Academy of Science of Albania.\nOn Monday, Zaev and his proposed Albanian coalition partners started talks on electing a new parliamentary speaker in a bid to persuade Macedonia's president to back down. Zaev is backed by 67 out of 120 lawmakers. VMRO is demanding a new election.\nIt isn't often a political dispute in a country of just 2 million prompts the alarm of policymakers in Brussels or Washington, but disputes in the Balkans historically have had outsized consequences for Europe \u2014 from the 1914 assassination by a Bosnian Serb of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, the heir presumptive to the Austro-Hungarian throne, which triggered the First World War, to the post-Cold War disintegration of the Yugoslav state that kicked off a decade of internecine warfare drawing in NATO.\nEarlier this month, the EU's foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, visited the Macedonian capital and urged Ivanov to allow Zaev to form a government.\n\"I asked the president to reflect on the way forward and to reverse his decision in the interests of all citizens in this country,\" Mogherini told reporters.\nEuropean Union leaders already are scrambling to try to tamp down an ethnic flare-up between Serbia and its former province Kosovo. In January, Serbia's president warned he's ready to send troops to Kosovo to protect Serbian nationals there, if necessary. Serbian President Tomislav Nikolic said the two countries were on the verge of a conflict.\nFILE - Gravestones are seen at sunrise at a memorial complex near Srebrenica, 150 kilometers (94 miles) northeast of Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina, July 11, 2015. Twenty years earlier, Serb troops overran the eastern Bosnian Muslim enclave of Srebrenica and executed 8,000 Muslim men and boys, which International courts have labeled as an act of genocide.\nBosnia-Herzegovina, Montenegro\nOther issues dividing parties and public opinion include whether to tilt geopolitically to the EU or Russia and border disputes. Ethnic tensions are on the rise also in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Montenegro. Bosnia remains split among Serbs, Bosnians and Croats, and the wounds of their vicious three-year-long war of the 1990s have not yet begun to heal.\nThe ethnic flare-ups coincide with the Kremlin's bid to expand its influence across an increasingly unstable Balkans, say analysts. From offering help with disaster relief to supplying sophisticated weaponry, including warplanes, Moscow has been on a charm offensive in a region Russia has viewed historically as in its sphere of influence.\nIn Serbia, Moscow's diplomatic offensive apparently is paying off. A recent Gallup Poll suggested Serbs viewed Russia as a more dependable ally than NATO, an organization Belgrade officially wants to join.\nIn Macedonia, a Russian hand is also being played. Moscow is accusing the West of trying to install a government in Macedonia that would help Albania pursue expansionist policies. EU leaders say Moscow is determined to stop the Balkans from integrating with NATO.\nZaev has warned that miscalculations in the current deadlock could \"set fire to the country.\"\n\n            ",

Police on suburban Long Island arrested Redzepagic on Feb. 2 on a minor, unrelated charge, and he told them: \"I'm going to leave this country, and I'm going to come back with an Army \u2014 Islam is coming,\" according to a federal court complaint.\nHis lawyer, Mildred Whalen, noted that Redzepagic is a citizen and had cooperated with law enforcement.\n\"We will be working with his family in the hope that the court and the government will see that what he needs is counseling and support, not imprisonment,\" she said in an email.\nAuthorities have prosecuted a number of people accused of trying to join the Islamic State group and other militants in recent years, though in some cases, the accused haven't actually succeeded in traveling overseas.\nRedzepagic \"was persistent in his efforts\" to join Islamic militants in civil-war-ravaged Syria, making it to Turkey in 2015 and Jordan last year and even getting to the Syrian border, said William F. Sweeney, assistant director in charge of the FBI's New York field office.\nRedzepagic, who lives in Commack, told authorities after his arrest that he'd become a devout Muslim while in Montenegro, in the Balkans, and believed a cousin was a battalion commander in Syria for the Islamic State or the group once known as the Nusra Front, according to the court complaint. The latter group \u2014 now called the Fatah al-Sham Front, and also known at times as Jabhat al-Nusra \u2014 is an al-Qaida affiliate.\nNo one immediately responded to phone or email messages to Redzepagic's relatives.\nAfter telling his cousin he wanted to join him, Redzepagic went to Turkey in July 2015 and aimed for Syria. He got cab rides to the border, then directions to a border wall manned by the military, followed by instructions to try to cross instead by making a two-day trip through the woods, the complaint says.\nHe'd been willing to put on a bomb and sacrifice himself, he told authorities after his arrest, though he told them at another point he just wanted to \"feed the children\" in Syria. But frustrated that he didn't getting more help crossing the border, Redzepagic returned to the U.S., the complaint says.\n\"Since I got back from Turkey from trying to perform jihad and join Jabhat al-Nusra the CIA has been bothering me,\" he wrote to a Facebook contact in October 2015, the complaint says. \"It's annoying but I out smarted them.\"\nThe CIA declined to comment Saturday on the case.\nHe also told various Facebook contacts that \"I just don't like this country,\" apparently meaning the U.S., and that \"jihad is the best for u,\" according to the complaint.\n\"There will come a time where people will only know to say Allahu akbar,\" he wrote in one message, using the Arabic phrase for \"God is great,\" says the complaint.\nRedzepagic went to Jordan last August to try again to get to Syria, but Jordanian officials stopped him and asked why he wanted to go there. He said he wanted to study Arabic, the complaint says.\nIt says he then told the same to U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials, who found he had electronic files about jihad. He said he'd downloaded them two years earlier, the complaint adds.\nIt's not immediately clear whether he remained on federal authorities' radar between then and his arrest in February. Long Island police notified federal authorities about the arrest, and although he was released without bail on the minor charge, he willingly continued talking to federal agents and let them scrutinize his phone, laptop and Facebook account, the complaint says.\n\n            ",

The roughly 7,000 former fighters have pledged to continue their struggle as a political movement.\nThe 7,132 weapons will be stored in containers until they are molded into a monument for peace.

There are security forces everywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone in my family is worried and if the situation gets worse, we\u2019ll have to leave.\u201d\nHeavy fighting\nAccording to U.S. estimates, government fighters control about 60 percent of the country, with the rest either controlled or contested by the insurgents, who are seeking to reimpose Islamic law after their 2001 ouster.\nAlthough the Taliban made a formal announcement of their spring offensive last week, there had been heavy fighting from the northern province of Badakhshan to the Taliban heartlands of Helmand and Kandahar in the south.\nIn the Helmand province Saturday, Gen. Aqa Noor Kentoz, provincial police chief, said at least four police officers were killed Friday night at a checkpoint on the outskirts of Lashkar Gah, the provincial capital.\nThe four might have been attacked by an insider, Kentoz said, and an investigation is underway.\nNo one immediately claimed responsibility.\nThere have also been several operations against Islamic State militants in the eastern province of Nangarhar, which have also involved U.S. special forces and air strikes.\nMore than 1,000 members of Afghan security forces have been killed since the start of the year, according to Afghan officials and figures cited by U.S. Congressional watchdog SIGAR, along with more than 700 civilians.\nAlso, more than 75,000 people have been forced to flee their homes in the first four months of the year, according to United Nations figures.\nMore troops needed\nEarlier this year, the top NATO commander in Afghanistan, Gen. John Nicholson, said he needed a few thousand more international troops to boost the Resolute Support training and advisory mission and break a \u201cstalemate\u201d with the Taliban.\nThe U.S. military is due to make its formal recommendations to President Donald Trump within the next week, a senior official told a Senate committee last week.\n\n            ",

Only the independent Danas (Today) and the Informer, a staunchly pro-Vucic outlet, opted against printing the candidate's red-and-blue AV logo-emblazoned poster without any news stories.\nBlic, Belgrade's splashy middle-market tabloid, did have one news article on the cover: an interview with Vucic's 14-year-old daughter. The headline: \"I Miss My Dad.\" Serbian election laws forbid using children in political and marketing campaigns.\nThursday's cover of the Serbian daily tabloid Blic featured an interview with presidential candidate Aleksandar Vucic's 14-year-old daughter, which violates laws forbidding such coverage, Belgrade, March 30, 2017. (Courtesy Blic)\nVucic remains the leading candidate heading into Sunday's election, with forecasts indicating that he holds more than 50 percent of the vote in a field of 11 candidates. Second-place candidate Ljubisa Preletacevic Beli, who holds an estimated 10 percent of the vote, responded to Thursday's news cycle via social media by posting a photo montage of blank newspaper covers.\nBeli, which means \"the white one,\" is the moniker of communications student Luka Maksimovic, 25, who moonlights as a comedic entertainer and initially launched his campaign as a joke.\nVucic, a former information minister under former President Slobodan Milosevic, was elected prime minister in 2014 on a reformist platform that vowed to lead the Balkan nation toward democracy.\nThursday's propaganda blitz stoked fears about the overall fairness of Sunday's vote.\n\"Today's print media have revealed the real state of democracy under Vucic's rule,\" former Serbian President Boris Tadic said in a public statement. \"We are looking at the North Korean scenario for Serbia if he wins the election.\"\n\"This is the last warning for the citizens of Serbia to come out and vote in order to defend freedom and democracy,\" Tadic added, slamming Serbian news outlets as slanted and fearful of challenging Vucic.\nSNS party chief Vladimir Orlic called it a legitimate, advertisement-driven marketing strategy, rejecting criticism of Vucic and claiming that Europe backs the incumbent.\n\"When it comes to the Macedonian, Ukrainian or Romanian scenario, and calling out for protests in the streets, we could only hear that from the opposition during this campaign,\" Orlic told VOA's Serbian service. \"We care about peace and stability and we don't need street fights and smashed heads.\"\nOpposition marginalized\nThe mainstream media under Vucic's control have largely demonized most of the 10 opposition challengers, without giving them the opportunity to respond.\nIn the social media sphere, commentators called Thursday the end of Serbian news ethics, and some netizens reminisced about the front pages that accompanied the death of former Yugoslavian President Josip Broz Tito in 1980. On that day, newspapers featured hagiographic portraits and appreciations of the late totalitarian to the exclusion of other news.\nIn Serbia, the office of the prime minister carries far more real power than that of the president, as in Germany and Austria and unlike the U.S., Russia or France, where the president dominates.\nVucic has not explained why he wants to move from the office of institutional authority to the one holding mostly ceremonial powers. Some analysts have said he made the decision out of fear that his ally and Serbia's incumbent president, Tomislav Nikolic, would struggle to win a second term and lose the post to the opposition.\nThis report was produced in collaboration with VOA's Serbian service.

He allegedly handed it over to U.S. intelligence officials who passed it on to Trump as well as President Barack Obama last week.\nMedia reports say it involved a hidden camera and sex tape made at a hotel room in Moscow when Trump visited in 2013 as well as alleged contacts between Trump\u2019s advisers and Russian officials.\nTrump denied the existence of any such tape and was quick to dismiss the claims and implication that Russia could be using any compromising information against him.\nWATCH: Trump thanks media for coming out against 'fake news'\nVideo size\nwidth\nx\nheight\npixels\nTrump Thanks News Media for Coming Out Against 'Fake News'\nShare this video\n0:00:56\n\u25b6\n0:00:00\n/0:00:56\n\u25b6\n\u25b6\nDirect link\n270p | 2.6MB\n360p | 2.9MB\n480p | 15.9MB\nRussians react\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Wednesday called the allegations \u201cpulp fiction\u201d and an attempt to harm bilateral ties.

And the U.S. commander of the global coalition against IS described the fighting in Mosul as the \"most extended and brutal combat I have ever witnessed.\"\nIraqis visit Pentagon\nBut Iraqi military officials visiting the Pentagon this week, following the declarations of victory over IS in Mosul, appeared undaunted.\n\"Very soon, we'll start military operations to liberate the remaining Iraqi areas under occupation,\" Joint Operations Command spokesman Brig. Gen. Yahya Rasool said through a translator.\n\"We could start military operations toward different areas at the same time,\" Rasool added. \"We're confident that we are capable of having a number of operations simultaneously.\"\nRasool and the other government officials indicated Iraqi leaders have yet to make a firm decision on exactly how the campaign should play out, though potential targets include Tal Afar, about 60 kilometers to the west of Mosul, and the town of Hawija in Iraq's Kirkuk province.\nA member of Iraqi Federal police walks along destroyed buildings from clashes in the Old City of Mosul, Iraq, July 10, 2017.\nU.S. officials have said efforts to clear Mosul of pockets of Islamic State fighters could last for weeks.\nIraqi soldiers told VOA that the remaining IS fighters, as well as women and children \u2014 all wearing suicide vests \u2014 are now launching attacks from basements and tunnels under the city.\nStriking at IS\nStill, Iraqi and U.S. officials see an opportunity to strike at IS while it is weak and still reeling from the loss.\n\"They're fighting among themselves in Hawija and Tal Afar, currently,\" Rasool said Thursday, when asked about what is left of IS leadership following the battle for Mosul.\n\"We killed a large number of the leadership, and they collapsed within their structure,\" he said.\nVehicles used for suicide car bombings, made by Islamic State militants, are seen at Federal Police Headquarters after being confiscated in Mosul, Iraq, July 13, 2017.\nU.S. officials estimate there are still a couple of thousand IS fighters spread throughout Iraq. Some analysts suggest the numbers could be even higher, and both officials and experts worry about the presence of so-called sleeper cells in all the territories that have been reclaimed from IS forces.\nAside from strongholds in Tal Afar and Hawija, IS still controls swaths of lands in Iraq's Anbar province, where they continue to enjoy some freedom of movement despite pressure from the coalition's ongoing air campaign.\nIraqi officials say continued coalition air support will be crucial for their continued success, and admit additional help will be needed.\n\"What we would like from the international or global coalition is the continuous support to Iraqi forces,\" said Brig. Gen Saad Maan, a spokesman for Baghdad Operations Command and the Iraqi Ministry of the Interior. \"This also requires additional training, and providing the basic services, and cameras, and surveillance equipment so that we'll be able to stabilize the area.\"\nTough fight ahead\nAs far as how long it will take to subdue what remains of IS, neither Iraqi nor coalition officials have been willing to say.\nIn this July 13, 2017 photo, Ali Mahdi, 9, poses for a photo while playing on his damaged street on the west side of Mosul, Iraq.\n\"It's been a tough fight. There's a lot of tough fighting ahead,\" U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said Friday.\n\"We're there to help them fight and defeat and destroy that physical caliphate and I'm sure we'll continue to bring in air support,\" Mattis said.\nThe U.S. and other coalition partners, including Australia, Finland and Britain, have also continued to train Iraqi forces for the battles ahead.\n\"The Iraqi Security Forces and the coalition have a plan to get after them. And we will move with all due speed to do that,\" Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend, Operation Inherent Resolve Commander, told Pentagon reporters on July 11. \"We'll be at it until it's done.\"\nFor their part, despite a looming referendum on Kurdish independence, peshmerga officials say their forces are ready and willing to support Iraqi military efforts to wipe out IS.\n\"We can launch a number of operations,\" said Brig.

Moments ago I was fired,\" Bharara said in the tweet. \"Being the US Attorney in SDNY will forever be the greatest honor of my professional life.\"\nJust over three months ago, then-President-elect Donald Trump asked Bharara to remain as U.S. attorney in Manhattan and Bharara told reporters after the Trump Tower meeting that he had agreed to do so.\nBharara was appointed by former President Barack Obama in 2009. In frequent public appearances, Bharara has decried public corruption after successfully prosecuting over a dozen state lawmakers, Democrats and Republicans alike.\nSessions' decision to include Bharara's name on the list of 46 resignations of holdovers from the Obama administration surprised Manhattan prosecutors.\nWhile it is customary for a new president to replace virtually all of the 93 U.S. attorneys, it often occurs at a slower pace. Sessions lost his position as U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Alabama in a similar sweep by then-Attorney General Janet Reno in 1993.\nNew York Sen. Charles Schumer, a Democrat, said in a statement Friday that he was \"troubled to learn\" of the resignation demands, particularly of Bharara, since Trump called him in November and assured him that he wanted Bharara to remain Manhattan's top federal prosecutor.\nAfter Bharara met Trump on Nov. 30, he emerged from the meeting to say Trump had asked him to remain in the job he has held since his appointment in the summer of 2009 and he had agreed.\nSchumer said that by requesting immediate resignations, Trump was \"interrupting ongoing cases and investigations and hindering the administration of justice.\"\nBharara, who was once lauded on the cover of Time magazine as the man who is \"busting Wall Street\" after successfully prosecuting dozens of insider traders, has in the past few years set his sights on prosecuting over a dozen state officeholders -- Democrats and Republicans -- including New York's two most powerful lawmakers.\nIt also recently was revealed that Bharara's office is investigating the financial terms of settlements of sexual-harassment claims against Fox News by its employees.\nThe request from Sessions came as Bharara's office is prosecuting former associates of Democratic Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo in a bribery case. Also, prosecutors recently interviewed New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio as part of a probe into his fundraising. The mayor's press secretary has said the mayor is cooperating and that he and his staff had acted appropriately.\nThe request for resignations came just days after Trump last weekend claimed that Obama tapped his telephones during last year's election. FBI Director James Comey privately asked the Justice Department to dispute the claim because he believed the allegations were false. Bharara worked for Comey when he was U.S. attorney in Manhattan under President George W. Bush.\nLast week, the quick-witted Bharara initiated a new personal Twitter feed with one of his first tweets perhaps intentionally delivering multiple messages.\nIn it, he linked to an AP video of a Senate hearing focusing on whether federal prosecutors were fired for political reasons.\n\"This Senate hearing on political interference (at)DOJ was 10 yrs ago today,\" Bharara wrote. \"Is that me in the background? Boy I've aged.\"\n\n            ",

Why should they? They think they are winning and 3,000 troops is not going to dramatically change the dynamics.\"\nSpeaking Thursday during a U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee hearing, the Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats said the Taliban is likely to make gains in rural areas while the government is being undermined by the country's \"dire economic situation.\"\nA U.S. watchdog estimates Taliban controls around 11 percent of districts with some 30 percent contested in battles with Afghan forces.\nAnalysts agree with Coats and other U.S. officials who say the Afghan security and military apparatus needs to be fixed.\n\"The Afghan government must start assigning merit-based appointments of competent individuals in key security posts,\" Koskinas said. \"Without strong leadership, that is currently lacking in the ministries of defense and interior, and from operational to tactical units, the surge of troops has no chance of improving security or countering the Taliban expansion.\"\nCorruption in the ranks\nFILE - Relatives carry the coffin of one of the victims a day after an attack on an army headquarters in Mazar-i-Sharif, northern Afghanistan, April 22, 2017.\nBesides battling an emboldened insurgency, Afghan security forces face rampant corruption in their ranks.\n\"The ineffective and corrupt Afghan government is one of the problems,\" said analyst David Des Roches, who teaches at the National Defense University in Washington. \"I think the Afghan government reform should be our priority.\"\nThe watchdog, U.S. Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR), has repeatedly warned that corruption and mismanagement could lead to military failure in the country.\n\"Afghanistan has enough security forces and if they are strategically used under the right leadership, they are capable of defending the country,\" said Afghan lawmaker Abdul Jabbar Qahraman, who was tasked by Afghan President Ashraf Ghani to oversee anti-Taliban offensives in the southern restive Helmand province.\nAdditional U.S. troops would be most beneficial if they are used to prop up Afghan forces and enable them to succeed, analysts say.\n\"The new plan should strengthen the capabilities of the Afghan national army that the U.S. has been training,\" said Wadir Safi, a Kabul University professor of politics. \"They should get more training and equipment to eventually take over the country's defense and security.\"\nPakistan's link\nThe Durand line, on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border\nBut Taliban do not operate in Afghanistan alone.\nAfghanistan has long accused Pakistan of tolerating and supporting militant groups that have carried out attacks across their shared borders. The United States has also pressed Islamabad to do more to crack down on such groups. Pakistan rejects allegations of employing proxies from its soil, saying Pakistan itself is a victim of terrorism.\nBut analysts say a U.S. troop surge in Afghanistan must be accompanied with forcing Pakistan to crackdown on support the Afghan Taliban receive from sanctuaries on Pakistani soil.\n\"Pakistan is not helping the security situation in Afghanistan,\" analyst Koskinas said. \"Their [Pakistan] support for the Taliban has not been curbed by American carrots. But we've never really applied any sticks as complement to the carrot. The U.S. needs a separate and comprehensive strategy to influence Pakistan.\"\nPakistani defense analyst, Talat Masood believes that Islamabad should take the impending U.S. troop surge as a signal that the U.S is serious about ridding insurgency in Afghanistan and the region.\n\"Pakistan needs to cut its links with the Taliban,\" he said.\nStill, Coats conceded Thursday that Afghanistan is likely to struggle until it can either contain the insurgency or reach a peace agreement with Taliban. And analysts wonder whether the U.S. troop surge would succeed in doing that.\n\"Can you put enough pain on the Taliban that they would say we can't go on with this and we will go for a negotiated settlement?\" Des Roches asked. \"There are Pakistani safe havens whether it is due to Pakistani lack of ability or Pakistani collusion, and as long as they [Taliban] are fighting for their life, it seems unlikely that this will defeat them.\"\nVOA's Afghan, Deewa and Urdu services contributed to this report. \n\n            ",

Two people were killed and 34 injured at the trendy Drugstore Publicis.\nKnown worldwide as Carlos, the 67-year-old is already serving a life sentence in France for a series of murders and attacks he has been convicted of perpetrating or organizing in the country on behalf of the Palestinian cause or communist revolution in the 1970s and '80s.\nAs the trial opened Monday, Carlos denounced it as a \"gross manipulation of justice\" 42 years after the attack. He has denied involvement and pleaded innocent.\nAsked to state his profession before the court, he called himself a \"professional revolutionary,\" and said \"I'm doing fine\" in prison - after more than 20 years behind bars.\nIf convicted of first-degree murders in the trial, which lasts through March 31, he could get a third life sentence.\nAt the time of the 1974 attack, Ramirez Sanchez was 24 years old and already had joined the organization Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, but hadn't yet achieved worldwide notoriety.\nWhen police arrived at the scene of the attack, they found a devastated mall with all the windows shattered, multiple bloodstains and a hole in the marble slab of the ground floor where the grenade fell. The two men who died were hit by metal chips that perforated vital organs and caused internal bleeding, according to court documents.\nHis long-time lawyer and fiance, Isabelle Coutant-Peyre, claims that none of the witnesses had described a man resembling her client, and that the whole case was trumped-up.\nThe case took so long to go to trial because it was first dismissed for lack of evidence before being reopened when Carlos was arrested and imprisoned in France. His lawyers repeatedly argued against holding a trial, arguing the attack was too long ago and that it won't make a difference for Carlos, already in prison for life.\n\"What need is there to hold this trial?\" asked one of Carlos' lawyers, Isabelle Coutant-Peyre. \"It's a useless trial.\"\nThe attack's victims, however, are relieved. \"The civil parties demand justice,\" said Georges Holleaux, lawyer for the widows of the two men killed in the attack and other civil parties to the case.\nProsecutor Remi Crosson du Cormier argued that the trial remains relevant today. \"Democracy has two principal enemies - totalitarianism, and terrorism,\" he said, suggesting that Carlos is among \"those who threaten democracy by their actions.\"\nThe case is being heard by a special court made up of professional judges and with no jurors, as is the custom with terrorism trials in France.\nYet an Arab language news magazine in France, Al Watan Al Arabi, published a long interview with a man it identified as Ramirez Sanchez five years after the attack. He allegedly claimed he had personally thrown the grenade into the restaurant, described the full details of the operation and explained why it was carried out. Carlos later disputed he had given the interview.\nCarlos was arrested in Sudan by the French intelligence services in 1994, in a dramatic sting.\n\n            ",

But the idea is exposing deep divisions within the administration on the best way to approach Moscow in the midst of an ongoing investigation into Russian meddling in the U.S. elections.\nMany administration officials believe the U.S. needs to maintain its distance from Russia at such a sensitive time \u2014 and interact only with great caution.\nBut Trump and some others within his administration have been pressing for a full bilateral meeting. He's calling for media access and all the typical protocol associated with such sessions, even as officials within the State Department and National Security Council urge more restraint, according to a current and a former administration official.\nSome advisers have recommended that the president instead do either a quick, informal \"pull-aside\" on the sidelines of the summit, or that the U.S. and Russian delegations hold \"strategic stability talks,\" which typically don't involve the presidents. The officials spoke anonymously to discuss private policy discussions.\nFILE - Russian President Vladimir Putin chairs a Security Council meeting in Moscow, June 16, 2017.\nThe contrasting views underscore differing views within the administration on overall Russia policy, and Trump's eagerness to develop a working relationship with Russia despite the ongoing investigations.\nRussian reaction\nAsked about the AP report that Trump is eager for a full bilateral meeting, Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters in Moscow on Monday that \"the protocol side of it is secondary.\"\nFILE - Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov attends a meeting of Russian President Vladimir Putin with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia, April 27, 2017.\nThe two leaders will be attending the same event in the same place at the same time, Peskov said, so \"in any case there will be a chance to meet.\" Peskov added, however, that no progress in hammering out the details of the meeting has been made yet.\nThere are potential benefits to a meeting with Putin. A face-to-face meeting can humanize the two sides and often removes some of the intrigue involved in impersonal, telephone communication. Trump \u2014 the ultimate dealmaker \u2014 has repeatedly suggested that he can replace the Obama-era damage in the U.S.-Russia relationship with a partnership, particularly on issues like the ongoing Syria conflict.\nPotential risks \nThere are big risks, though. Trump is known to veer off-script, creating the possibility for a high-stakes diplomatic blunder. In a brief Oval Office meeting with top Russian diplomats last month, Trump revealed highly classified information about an Islamic State group threat to airlines that was relayed to him by Israel, according to a senior administration official. The White House defended the disclosures as \"wholly appropriate.\"\nIn addition, many observers warn that Putin is not to be trusted.\nOleg Kalugin, a former general with Russia's main security agency, known as the KGB, said Putin, a shrewd and experienced politician, has \"other priorities\" than discussing the accusations that Russia hacked the U.S. election with Trump, such as easing sanctions, raising oil prices, as well as next year's presidential elections in Russia.\n\"Putin knows how to redirect a conversation in his favor,\" Kalugin said.\nNina Khrushcheva, a Russian affairs professor at the New School, said Trump is in an \"impossible position.\"\n\"He can't be too nice to Putin because it's going to be interpreted in a way that suggests he has a special relationship with Russia,\" she said. \"He can't be too mean because Putin has long arms and KGB thinking. So Trump needs to have a good relationship with him but he also needs to fulfill his campaign promises of establishing better relations with Russia.\"\nThe White House said no final decision has been made about whether a meeting will take place. It did not respond to questions about the opposing views within the administration.\nBilateral meetings are common during summits like the G-20, where many world leaders and their advisers are gathered in one place.\nFILE - U.S. President Barack Obama, left, speaks with Russian President Vladimir Putin, right prior to the opening session of the G-20 summit in Antalya, Turkey, Nov. 15, 2015.\nThe meetings are typically highly choreographed affairs, with everything from the way the two leaders shake hands to the looks that they exchange and the actual words spoken offering glimpses into the state of affairs.\nThe last U.S.-Russia bilateral meeting was a 2015 encounter between Putin and President Barack Obama that began with an awkward handshake and ended with progress on the brutal civil war in Syria.\nFILE - U.S. President Barack Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, Sept. 28, 2015.\nThat 2015 meeting, the first in two years, involved a 90-minute sit-down at U.N. headquarters. Putin and U.S. officials later said the two leaders had made progress on issues related to Syria, which had strained their already tense relationship. For the Obama administration, cautious engagement was the name of the game, with the U.S. working tirelessly to find middle ground with Moscow on Syria, Ukraine and other issues.\nThe disconnect between Trump and his advisers in the State Department and National Security Council over Russia runs deeper than the debate over a G-20 bilateral.\nMore careful approach urged \nA former administration official who spoke anonymously to discuss classified information said that frustration is growing among foreign policy advisers over the failure of the White House to embrace a more cautious and critical approach to Russia. All 17 U.S. intelligence agencies have agreed Russia was behind last year's hack of Democratic email systems and tried to influence the 2016 election to benefit Trump.\nTrump has to directly \"say to Putin, 'We're not happy about you interfering in our election,'\" said Steven Pifer, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. \"If you don't say that, you are going to get hammered by the press and Congress and you can guarantee Congress will pass sanctions legislation against Russia.\"\n\"They also need to keep their expectations very, very modest,\" added Pifer. \"If they aim for a homerun in Hamburg, my guess is they'll strike out.\"\n\n            ",

In the past few months, the jihadists\u2019 media output had decreased significantly, likely as the result of the military pressure IS has come under across its self-declared caliphate in both Iraq and Syria.\nJust days before the IS-claimed New Year\u2019s Eve attack on the Reina nightclub in Istanbul that left 39 dead, the group released a video of two Turkish soldiers being forced to crawl on all fours before being burned alive. First posted with an Arabic language commentary on December 22 and re-released Monday with an English language voice-over, the video accused Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of siding with apostates and the Christian West.\nAnd just after Christmas, IS propagandists released a chilling half-hour video of child jihadists as young as nine years old participating in live-fire training exercises, shooting first at dummies and then at captives with their hands bound and trying to elude them in a debris-strewn building. In the video, captives are shown weeping after being cornered by the mini mob of indoctrinated boys, who gun them down at point-blank range.\nScenes in the video included the boys, known as cubs of the caliphate, taking Quran classes, studying execution videos and pledging allegiance to terror leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, while brandishing automatic weapons.\nFILE - \u0410 screen grab from an Islamic State propaganda video shows child soldiers, known as cubs of the caliphate, at an alleged IS training camp.\nMilitary challenges\nThe media surge is a response to the increasingly dangerous military challenge the group is facing, says former U.S. ambassador Alberto Fernandez, now with The Middle East Media Research Institute, a Washington-based research organization that monitors jihadist propaganda.\n\u201cJust like IS has tried to surge in its overseas attacks and responded fiercely to military advances in northern Syria and Mosul, they are trying to fight against the idea that they are in an inexorable decline,\u201d he says.\nThe video posted this week recalls earlier 2014 IS productions in terms of slickness and editing techniques. \nIt begins with footage of multiple VBIED (vehicle-borne improvised explosive device) suicide attacks carried out by jihadists in Mosul. Suicide bombers are interviewed by IS videographers before bombing runs. One bomber is crippled and wheeled off to his waiting bomb-rigged vehicle in a wheelchair. As with others, his attack and its aftermath are filmed by a drone.\nAnalysts have noted in recent months a sharp drop in the output of Islamic State propaganda, which is largely credited with having helped the terror group recruit an estimated 30,000 foreign fighters. Last year, the group posted online a fraction of the videos and images it produced in 2014 and 2015, and has for months appeared to be struggling to maintain production as it has come under growing pressure from foes on the battlefield, according to researchers.\nA study released in October by the Combating Terrorism Center at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, showed there had been a plunge, with a decline from a peak of 761 releases a month in August of 2015, to just 194 a year later. \n\u201cIt is clear the organization has been forced to cut back these activities in response to the increasing amount of pressure brought to bear,\u201d concluded the West Point researchers.\nFILE - A screenshot from an Islamic State propaganda video purports to show young boys preparing to execute a group of captives.\nDwindling resources\nThey argued the decline is evidence IS finds it a challenge to devote the personnel and secure the resources to keep up production rates of its propaganda bid.\nMost of the reduction in media output has likely been a direct consequence of military offensives against the group in Iraq and Syria, which have seen the territory controlled by the jihadists reduced dramatically. Media production facilities have been destroyed and propagandists killed in airstrikes. They include two of the terror group\u2019s top propagandists, Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, who personally selected execution videos and was killed in late August, and his replacement, Abu Muhammad Furqan, who was killed a month later.\nAnalysts point out the latest long-form videos produced by IS in recent weeks are less experimental and don\u2019t exhibit the more complex and demanding techniques used in IS videos in 2014 and 2015. Aside from the drone footage, less demanding filming and editing techniques are used in the video posted Wednesday.\nThe terror group\u2019s propagandists also appear to be struggling to produce multi-language versions of videos. In 2014 and 2015, videos were posted in different language versions at the same time. Now the videos tend only to be in Arabic.\n\n            ",

He called their return one of the \"most special days in the history of our museum.\"\nThe paintings, the 1882 \"View of the Sea at Scheveningen,\" and 1884-85 work \"Congregation leaving the Reformed Church in Nuenen,\" were discovered last year by Italian police investigating suspected Italian mobsters for cocaine trafficking.\nIt wasn't an easy find. The two paintings were wrapped in cotton sheets, stuffed in a box and hidden behind a wall in a toilet, said Gen. Gianluigi D'Alfonso of the Italian financial police, who was on hand at the museum to watch the ceremonial unveiling.\nThey were found in a farmhouse near Naples as Italian police seized some 20 million euros worth of assets, including villas, apartments and even a small airplane. Investigators contend the assets are linked to two Camorra drug kingpins, Mario Cerrone and Raffaele Imperiale.\n\"After years shrouded in darkness, they can now shine again,\" Dutch Minister for Education, Culture and Science Jet Bussemaker said as an orange screen slid away to reveal the two paintings behind a glass wall.\nItaly's Interior Minister Angelino Alfano said last year the paintings were \"considered among the artworks most searched for in the world, on the FBI's list of the Top 10 art crimes.\"\nThey are now back on display at the museum before being taken to its conservation studio for repair, although they suffered remarkably little damage as thieves who had clambered up a ladder and smashed a window to get into the museum in 2002 ripped them out of their frames and fled.\n\"It is not only a miracle that the works have been recovered but it's even more miraculous almost that they are in relatively unharmed condition,\" Rueger said.\nThe museum director was on vacation when the call came last year from Italian authorities who believed they had recovered the paintings. He didn't celebrate right away; he'd had calls like this before.\n\"I was hopeful but also a little hesitant because over the course of the years we had multiple occasions when people phoned us, contacted us, claiming that they knew something about the whereabouts of the works and each time it was false, the trace went cold,\" he said. \"So ... the way has been peppered with disappointment.\"\nBut museum experts dispatched to Italy to check the authenticity of the works quickly turned Rueger's doubts into delight.\n\"It was something we had secretly been hoping for for all those years,\" he said.\nThe two small works are not typical of Van Gogh's later and better-known works, but are still vital pieces for the museum's collection, Rueger said.\nThe Scheveningen seascape, with a fishing boat and rough sea under a typically gray, cloudy Dutch sky, is one of Van Gogh's earliest works and the only painting in the museum's collection painted during his time in The Hague. It suffered a missing rectangular chip from the bottom left-hand corner.\nThe painting of the church in Nuenen portrayed the village where his parents lived.\n\"He had painted as a gift to his mother, so it's a very personal and emotional connection,\" Rueger said.\nRueger said the paintings are now back for good at a museum which is home to dozens of works by Van Gogh, whose paintings fetch millions of dollars on the rare occasions they come up for auction.\n\"The security, I can assure you, is of Triple-A quality now so I'm very confident that everything is safe in the museum,\" he said.\n\n            ",

The Trump administration is simply reiterating what has been policy, with slight variations,\u201d said Rashid Abdi, a Horn of Africa analyst with the International Crisis Group. \u201cU.S. special forces are already on the ground. Drone attacks have been scaled up.\u201d\nAdvise and assist\nCurrently about 50 U.S. commandos rotate in and out of this Horn of Africa nation to advise and assist local troops. The commandos have accompanied Somali forces in several raids against al-Shabab fighters in which dozens of militants were killed, according to Somali intelligence officials, who insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press.\nSomalia, which has been without an effective central government since the fall of dictator Siad Barre in 1991, was one of the seven predominantly Muslim countries included in Trump\u2019s recent travel ban. That executive order has since been suspended by federal courts.\nFILE - Former members of the militant group al-Shabab are held inside the prison in Garowe, Puntland state in northeastern Somalia, Dec. 14, 2016. Al-Shabab claimed responsibility for the shooting death of a Puntland senior official, Dec. 20, 2016.\nAl-Shabab emerged amid Somalia\u2019s years of chaos. A regional military effort several years ago pushed the extremist group from the capital, Mogadishu, and most other urban centers. But experts say that push against al-Shabab then weakened, allowing it to regroup and adapt to operating in the country\u2019s vast rural areas. It recently stepped up attacks in the capital and elsewhere.\nThe U.S. has military bases in Somalia, although it has not publicly acknowledged them. They are often used for drone attacks against al-Shabab targets. One of the largest bases is at Baledogle airfield, a former Somali air force base in Lower Shabelle region where U.S. military experts also train Somali forces, according to Somali officials.\nIn the past year the U.S. launched 14 airstrikes, nearly all drone strikes, killing some top al-Shabab leaders, including Hassan Ali Dhore and Abdullahi Haji Daud, according to a Somali intelligence official who coordinated with the U.S. on some of them. \nThe attacks have helped combat al-Shabab but have not brought the group to its knees, the official said.\nThe main successes against al-Shabab have come from the 22,000-strong African Union regional force that has operated in Somalia since 2007. But the AU force plans to withdraw by the end of 2020, and cost is a primary reason. The annual mission\u2019s budget has risen from $300 million in 2009 to $900 million in 2016, said Ahmed Soliman, an analyst with Chatham House, the London-based think tank.\nWithout the African Union troops, the fight against al-Shabab will be left to the Somali army, widely regarded as weak and disorganized. Building the army into an effective force will be the primary challenge facing the United States.\nThe U.S. military probably plans to step up training and coordination but not actually put more American boots on the ground in Somalia, Soliman said. The Black Hawk Down incident of 1993, in which two U.S. helicopters were shot down in Mogadishu and bodies of Americans were dragged through the streets, is a factor discouraging more direct U.S. involvement. Even now, the U.S. has no embassy in Somalia. \nFILE - Somalia's President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, also known as Farmajo, attends his inauguration ceremony in Mogadishu, Somalia, Feb. 22, 2017.\nAl-Shabab in recent weeks has increased bombings in Mogadishu, threatening the security efforts of new Somali-American President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, during whose time as prime minister in 2010-2011 the group was expelled from the capital. The extremists continue to dominate remote towns and villages across the south and central parts of the country. \nBut a new security threat in Somalia, and a challenge to any U.S. military efforts, is the emergence of Islamic State group-linked fighters, who officials fear could expand their foothold beyond the semi-autonomous north. The fighters broke away from al-Shabab and declared allegiance to the Islamic State group in 2015. Al-Shabab sees the splinter group as a threat to its operations.\n\u201cIt\u2019s only al-Shabab that can stand in ISIS\u2019 way to expand its areas of operation \u2014 Somali forces are now too disorganized to stop them,\u201d said Ahmed Mohamoud, a retired former Somali military general. \n\n            ",

The special units, known as SIUs, were formed starting in the 1990s precisely to create more secure groups that the U.S. could feel more comfortable sharing intelligence with. Castilla said Reyes Arzate had been fired in November.\nAccording to the U.S. indictment, Reyes Arzate was caught on a wiretap in September telling a drug trafficker to get rid of his communications equipment because he was under investigation and his phones were being tapped.\nFILE - Mexican federal police officers are seen standing guard during a raid.\nHe even sent the trafficker a surveillance photo that the Mexican unit had taken of him.\nThe U.S. indictment unsealed Wednesday in Chicago says Reyes Arzate was the top commander of an SIU unit whose officers were specially trained and vetted by the United States, including weeklong training at a DEA school in Quantico, Virginia.\nA former federal police official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he is no longer with the agency said Reyes Arzate was probably two or three steps down in the command chain from the federal police commissioner.\n\"Reyes, in his role as supervisor over the SIU, routinely had contact and worked collaboratively with DEA agents in Mexico City,\" according to the indictment.\n'Severe integrity issues'\nMike Vigil, a former chief of international operations for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, said there had always been a problem with the special units: The top commanders refused to submit to background or polygraph checks, even though low-level agents were vetted.\n\"The higher echelon, the higher level of the federal police, do not want to be vetted,\" Vigil said. \"So the information that goes from the vetted units to their commanders can be easily compromised.\"\n\"We have pushed for that ... they have never wanted to and I think that a lot of them have severe integrity issues, so they don't want to go through that vetting because they're afraid of what we may find out,\" Vigil said. \"A lot of them are corrupt so they don't want to be vetted. If we were able to vet them from top to bottom, it would be a great program.\"\nWhat is startling is the length and depth of Reyes Arzate's collusion with the Beltran Leyva gang, which has built a reputation of specializing in corrupting or bribing law enforcement officials.\nBeyond giving the drug trafficker detailed advice on how to evade the DEA investigation, the commander passed on to him fresh information given to him by the U.S. agency.\nFILE - Alleged drugdealer Alfredo Beltran Leyva is showed to the media by members of the Mexican Army in Mexico City, on January 21, 2008, after being captured in Culiacan, in the northwestern state of Sinaloa, along with three other members of his gang.\nAn unidentified confidential source cited in the indictment said Reyes Arzate had directly passed tips to Arturo Beltran Leyva, the cartel boss who was killed in 2009. That meant that Reyes Arzate had been a cartel mole in police agencies for at least seven years.\nThe cartel even killed a DEA informant based on information supplied by Reyes Arzate. \n'There seems to be a pattern here'\nIt raised questions about how Mexican authorities could possibly have missed such longstanding, outrageous corruption.\nStill, it's not the first time Mexico has failed to detect such deep corruption.\nThe indictment comes about a week after the attorney general for the Mexican state of Nayarit was arrested at the U.S. border on drug charges.\nEdgar Veytia was charged in the United States with conspiracy to smuggle cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine to the U.S. from January 2013 to last month, while he was chief law enforcement officer in the Pacific coast state of Nayarit.\nThe revelations about two such-high-ranking officers could fuel continuing tensions between Mexico and the United States.\nMexican security analyst Alejandro Hope said \"there seems to be a pattern here.\"\n\"In both cases, the arrests were made without the participation of Mexican authorities. Confidence is not at its highest level.\"\nAdded Vigil: \"It detracts from the working relationship we have worked so hard to build.\"\n\n            ",

He was 82.\nHerzog was a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative Christian Democratic Union. He served as the chief justice of Germany's highest court before being elected to a five-year term as president in 1994, four years after reunification.\n\"Roman Herzog fulfilled the duties of the highest government post in his own inimitable way. He was frank, unpretentious, humorous and self-ironic,\" Merkel said.\n\"In European politics and confronting our past, Roman Herzog knew how to send important signals, through choosing the right words, or through silence, in places where there were no words, such as the former death camp of Auschwitz.\"\nGermany's current president, Joachim Gauck, described Herzog as a \"distinctive personality, who had helped shape Germany's self-image and the interactions in our society\".\nHerzog last year hit out at the big political parties for not doing more to halt the rise of the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which looks poised to become the third largest party in parliament in national elections this year.\nIn 1995, during a visit to the former Nazi death camp in Bergen-Belsen, Herzog warned against the rise of new forms of exclusion and totalitarianism.\n\"So we must remain vigilant. And for that we have to remember. Only those who remember can banish dangers for the future,\" he said.\nAfter his term as president, a largely ceremonial post in Germany, Herzog also chaired the first European convention that drafted the European Union's Charter of Fundamental Rights.\n\"Today we have lost a great constitutional scholar, politician and statesman,\" said German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier in a statement.\nMaram Stern, deputy chief executive of the World Jewish Congress, hailed Herzog as a \"great fighter for the constitutional state and for a free and tolerant society.\"\n\n            ",

Senator John McCain, Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, wrote to the White House last month seeking information about Flynn's contacts with Russia.\nBut of all of the Congressional probes, perhaps the most consequential is being led by the Senate Intelligence Committee, the panel responsible for such high-profile investigations as the inquiries into the CIA's controversial torture practices in 2014 and the 2012 militant attacks on two U.S. government facilities in Benghazi, Libya.\nNot only does the committee have the widest jurisdiction over intelligence matters with staff and resources to investigate them, but the committee's investigation into the Russian interference enjoys the support of its ranking Democratic member, Mark Warner, even as other Republican-led congressional investigations have been criticized by Democrats as partisan.\nOptions regarding investigations\nAndrew Kent, a professor at Fordham Law School in New York who has written extensively about the investigations into Trump and Russia, said the FBI and congressional committees are focused on different aspects of the suspected Trump-Russia connections.\n\"The FBI focus is going to be at looking at whether any federal laws were broken,\" Kent said. \"The congressional committees can look a little bit more broadly and don't have a focus on whether specific laws were broken.\"\nFILE - U.S. President Donald Trump, left to right, joined by Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, Vice President Mike Pence, senior advisor Steve Bannon, Communications Director Sean Spicer and National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, speaks by phone with Russia's President Vladimir Putin in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, Jan. 28, 2017.\nWhile none of the investigations is truly independent, Kent said, there are at least four options to carry out such a probe: a congressional select committee with joint Republican-Democratic control; a congressionally-created bipartisan commission similar to the 9/11 panel; a special prosecutor; or an independent counsel with the full delegated power of the attorney general.\nBut given White House opposition and Republican control of Congress, he said none of the options seem likely at the moment.\nRichard Ben-Veniste, the former chief of the Watergate Task Force that investigated former President Richard Nixon in the 1970s, said Sessions should hand over control of the investigations to Acting Attorney General Dana Boente, who is a career prosecutor.\nBoente is \"an experienced prosecutor and far more likely to be deemed credible in terms of supervising the investigation,\" Ben-Veniste said.\nFILE - Dana Boente, then-first assistant U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, leaves federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, Jan. 26, 2012.\nAnother candidate would be Rod J. Rosenstein, a career prosecutor and the current U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland, who has been nominated by Trump as deputy attorney general. A confirmation hearing has been set for March 7.\n\"Senators will obviously have lots of questions for him about Trump-Russia issues,\" Kent said.\nIn Congress, while Republicans have roundly rejected Democratic calls for a select committee to investigate any Russia-Trump connections, the idea is likely to gain traction as new information comes to light, Kent said.\nWith the extent of the Trump campaign's ties to Russia unknown, Ben-Veniste said it is too early to say that the Russia questions will lead to a Watergate-style inquiry. However, he said he saw one parallel between the two high-stakes scandals.\n\"Historically we've seen similar circumstances where the party, in protecting its reputation, has said that it is unnecessary to create any special investigative apparatus to ensure the public of the integrity of the investigation,\" he said. \"Each time those initial protests are overcome and a special investigation takes place, it has been shown that there is fire behind the smoke.\"\n\n            ",

The remainder said they did not know enough to have an opinion.\nBut among those who have been closely following news of Comey's unexpected ouster, 53 percent said they disapprove and 33 percent approve.\nTrump fired Comey on Tuesday, at first saying he accepted recommendations from Attorney General Jeff Sessions and his deputy, Rod Rosenstein, that he be ousted because of the role he played last year in the investigation into Trump's presidential election challenger, Democrat Hillary Clinton, and the way she handled national security material on her private email server.\nBut by week's end, Trump said he had made up his mind to fire Comey regardless of the recommendations and was thinking of \"this Russia thing\" when he decided to dismiss Comey. The former FBI director had been leading the agency's investigation into the U.S. intelligence community's conclusion that Russia meddled in the 2016 election and possible collusion between Trump campaign aides and Russian officials.\nTrump said Saturday a new FBI director could possibly be named in the next few days, but whoever it might be is likely to undergo intense questioning at a Senate confirmation hearing, delaying the time when the appointee might actually take over control of the agency. Opposition Democratic lawmakers and some Republicans have called for a special prosecutor independent of the Department of Justice, which oversees FBI operations, to pursue the Russia probe.\n\"We can make a fast decision,\" Trump told reporters Saturday aboard Air Force One before flying to Lynchburg, Virginia to deliver a commencement address at Liberty University. He said it is possible he could appoint a new FBI director before heading Friday to the Middle East and Europe on his first overseas trip as president.\nNearly a dozen people are being considered, including attorneys, law enforcement officials, and lawmakers.\n\"I think the process is going to move quickly,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAlmost all of [the candidates] are very well-known.

He died in Rome.\nIn 1984 Pope John Paul named Navarro-Valls, a layman, to be Vatican spokesman and gave him direct access to his inner circle to a degree that no papal spokesman had before or has had since.\nThe photogenic Navarro-Valls became a celebrity in his own right, a global media personality often appearing on television to explain Catholic teachings in simple language.\n\"Joaquin Navarro-Valls embodied what Ernest Hemingway defined as courage: grace under pressure,\" said Greg Burke, the current Vatican spokesman.\nNavarro-Valls hardly ever lost his composure during his nearly 22 years at the side of John Paul, including during the twice daily medical briefings as the pope lay dying in the Vatican Apostolic Palace and the world waited.\nThe one exception was when a reporter asked him to put aside the medical details and explain how he felt as a person. Navarro became choked up and held back tears before millions watching on television.\nFor more than two decades the Polish-born Pope John Paul, his priest-secretary Stanislaw Dziwisz, and Navarro became a de-facto triumvirate in the Vatican.\nHis privileged access to the pope irritated some cardinals in the Vatican administration, who had to wait in line.\nHe occasionally took action without clearing it with the Secretariat of State, the Vatican's key administrative department. But such was his friendship with the pope that he always emerged from controversy unscathed.\nOn one such occasion in the mid 1990s he decided that the Vatican could no longer keep quiet about the pope's evidently failing health and disclosed that the pontiff was suffering from Parkinson's disease.\nPope John Paul also occasionally used Navarro for sensitive missions, bypassing the Vatican's own diplomats.\nIn 1998 he went to Cuba to negotiate directly with Fidel Castro to iron out last-minute snags over Pope John Paul's historic visit.\nDuring an all-night conversation punctuated by cigars and rum, Navarro-Valls convinced Castro to restore Christmas as a national holiday. It had been suppressed after the revolution.\nAfter John Paul's death in 2005, Navarro-Valls stayed on as spokesman for Pope Benedict for more than a year to help his transition and then left Vatican service.\nUntil his health began failing he was a director of a Rome hospital and medical school run by the conservative Catholic group Opus Dei, of which he was a member.\n\n            ",

Trump had tried but failed to frighten Iranians, Khamenei said.\n\"We are thankful to (Trump) for making our life easy as he showed the real face of America,\" Khamenei told a meeting of military commanders in Tehran, according to his website.\nThe White House has said the last week's missile test was not a direct breach of Iran's 2015 nuclear pact with six world powers, but that it \"violates the spirit of that\".\nIn remarks published on Tuesday, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said Tehran would not agree to renegotiate its nuclear agreement.\n\"I believe Trump will push for renegotiation. But Iran and European countries will not accept that,\" Mohammad Javad Zarif told Ettelaat newspaper. \"We will have difficult days ahead.\"\nOn the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly promised to tear up the nuclear deal. While his Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, has not called for an outright rejection of the accord, he has suggested a \"full review\" of it.\nThe supreme leader, Iran's top authority, also said Trump has \"confirmed what we have been saying for more than 30 years about the political, economic, moral and social corruption in the U.S. ruling system.\"\nTrump responded to a Jan. 29 Iranian missile test by saying \"Iran is playing with fire\" and slapping fresh sanctions on individuals and entities, some of them linked to Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards.\n\"No enemy can paralyze the Iranian nation,\" Khamenei said.\n\"(Trump) says 'you should be afraid of me'. No! The Iranian people will respond to his words on Feb. 10 and will show their stance against such threats.\"\nA U.N. Security Council resolution underpinning the pact urges Iran to refrain from testing missiles designed to be able to carry nuclear warheads, but imposes no obligation.\nUnder the accord, Iran agreed to curb its nuclear program in exchange for relief from some U.S., European and U.N. economic sanctions. Critics of Iran said the deal emboldened Tehran to increase its involvement in wars in Arab countries, a charge Tehran denies.\nPresident Hassan Rouhani said on Tuesday that, in contrast to Trump's view, the nuclear deal was a \"win-win\" accord, and could be used as a stepping stone to defuse tension in the region.\n\n            ",

Many Indonesians have drawn comparisons between Jokowi and Obama, who were both highly popular during their election campaigns.\nAfter Obama became president, many here viewed him as a native son and saw him as a symbol of hope and religious tolerance because of his years living in the world's most populous Muslim country.\nA statue of the boy still remembered as \"Barry\" by childhood friends was erected outside the elementary school he once attended in the capital's upscale, leafy neighborhood of Menteng.\nFILE - Former United States President Barack Obama (2nd left), his wife Michelle (3rd left) and with his daughters Sasha (center) and Malia (2nd right) go rafting while on holiday in Bongkasa Village, Badung Regency, Bali, Indonesia, June 26, 2017.\n\"This is the last opportunity for us to meet with Barry, our childhood friend who has made us so proud,\" said Widianto Cahyono, who sat next to Obama in the fourth grade and is hopeful the former president will visit his old neighborhood. \"We have long waited for a reunion with him.\"\nObama also retains a soft spot for Indonesia, where he lived from age 6 to 10.

The Guardian newspaper reported Friday that contractors installed a cheaper, less flame-resistant type of paneling in the renovation that ended in May 2016.\nTensions were high Friday two days after the overnight fire gutted the huge housing block, killing at least 30 people and leaving dozens missing and hundreds homeless.\nPolice officers confront demonstrators inside Kensington Town Hall, during a protest following the fire that destroyed The Grenfell Tower block, in north Kensington, West London, Britain, June 16, 2017.\nScuffles broke out near the Kensington and Chelsea town hall offices as demonstrators chanting \"We want justice!'' surged toward the doors.\nLondon has a chronic housing shortage even in the best of times, and those left homeless by the fire \u2014 already angry over what they see as government inequity and incompetence \u2014 fear being forced out of the British capital.\nThe Grenfell Tower housed about 600 people in 120 apartments. Britain's Press Association reported that some 70 people are still missing after the fire.\nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan said people were frustrated by the lack of information about the missing and the dead as well as a lack of coordination between support services.

May on Thursday announced a public inquiry while Khan called for an interim report on the fire to be published this summer.\nGrenfell Tower is a public housing project owned by the local government council and managed by a nonprofit known as the Kensington and Chelsea Tenants Management Organization. The group last year completed a 10 million pound ($12.8 million) renovation that included new outside insulation panels, double-paned windows and a communal heating system.\nPolice officers stand in front of the The Grenfell Tower block that was destroyed by fire, in north Kensington, West London, Britain, June 16, 2017.\nAluminum composite panels essentially consist of two thin layers of aluminum sandwiched around a lightweight insulating material. Standard versions use plastic such as polyethylene for the core, while more expensive variants use fire-resistant material.\nThe Guardian newspaper reported Friday that Omnis Exteriors supplied the aluminum composite material used in the cladding. The newspaper quoted company director John Cowley as saying the building used Reynobond PE cladding, which is 2 pounds cheaper ($2.56) per square meter than Reynobond FR, which stands for \"fire resistant.''\nThe International Building Code calls for the use of fire-resistant cores in buildings over 40 feet (12 meters) tall to slow the spread of flames.\nThe company that installed the exterior cladding, Harley Facades, issued a statement this week saying the panels are \"commonly used'' in refurbishing buildings. It did not address the exact makeup of the panels.\n\"It would not be appropriate for us to comment or for others to speculate on any aspect of fire, or its causes, in advance of these inquiries,'' managing director Ray Bailey said. \"At this time, we are not aware of any link between the fire and the exterior cladding to the tower.''\nA woman touches a missing poster for 12-year-old Jessica Urbano on a tribute wall after laying flowers on the side of Latymer Community Church next to the fire-gutted Grenfell Tower in London, June 16, 2017.\nFamilies searching for loved ones have blanketed the area near the tower with posters. Whole families are said to be among the missing.\nNearly 110 families made homeless from the blaze are being housed at hotels in west London.

You get a lot of fragmentation of bodies, charring of bones,'' said Peter Vanezis, a professor of forensic medical sciences at Queen Mary University in London. \"Sometimes all that's left is ash.''\nThe scorched facade of the Grenfell Tower in London, June 15, 2017, after a massive fire raced through the 24-storey high-rise apartment building in west London early Wednesday.\nVanezis said the best chance to identify victims may be if firefighters find bits of teeth or bone, medical devices like pacemakers or artificial implants.\n\"The longer a fire burns, the less chance you have that there will be enough DNA left to test,'' Vanezis said.\nEven amid the chaos and the frustration, some found a moment to seek unity. A special service was held Friday afternoon at the al-Manaar Muslim Cultural Heritage Centre to pray for the victims \u2014 and for the families waiting for news.\n\"Obviously, the longer people have to wait, especially finding out what happened to their loved ones, [that] can create anger,'' said Abdurahman Sayed, Chief Executive Officer of al-Manaar. \"We're just really anxiously waiting for the authorities really, [to see] what they are going to do.''\n\n            ",

However, China says the system\u2019s powerful radar could penetrate into its territory.\nDespite angry opposition from Beijing, the United States started to deploy the first elements of its advanced anti-missile defense system in South Korea last month.\nSouth Korean officials said McMaster spoke with his counterpart in Seoul, Kim Kwan-jin, Thursday morning to discuss the North\u2019s missile launch and the Trump-Xi summit.\n\u201cBoth sides agreed to pursue ... plans in order to substantially strengthen the international community\u2019s sanctions and pressure on North Korea,\u201d South Korea\u2019s presidential Blue House said in a statement.

Security Council resolutions.

Last week, a gay couple was publicly caned in conservative Aceh province, in the first-ever application of a 2015 sharia statute against homosexuality. And in West Java, Indonesia\u2019s most populous province, officials have announced the creation of an anti-LGBT \"task force.\u201d\nThe last two years have borne witness to unprecedented attacks on LGBT citizens in Indonesia, where gay sex is not illegal, except in Aceh. Jakarta is controlled by the central government.\nFILE - Police officers escort men arrested in a raid on a gay sauna at North Jakarta police headquarters in Jakarta, Indonesia, May 22, 2017.\nLast year, there was an acute \u201cgay panic\u201d where, among other things, a transgender boarding school was shut down, a former minister called on the public to kill gay people, and the Vice President personally attacked a UN program focused on LGBT rights.\nThose sentiments never completely died down, and this year\u2019s reaction to gay rights seems even more virulent. And the issue is impossible to disentangle from the overall rise in intolerance towards minorities that was exemplified by the racially charged campaign that unseated Jakarta\u2019s Chinese-Christian governor last month.\nEcho chamber effect\n\u201cGenerally speaking, conservatives have found the perfect target in the LGBT community,\u201d said Dede Oetomo, a veteran gay rights activist based in East Java. \u201cThe increased frequency of actions is alarming.\u201d\nFILE - Two men convicted of gay sex, center, are surrounded as Shariah law officials escort them to a mosque to be publicly caned in Banda Aceh, Aceh province, Indonesia, May 23, 2017.\nWith regards to the raids on sex clubs in Jakarta and Surabaya, Oetomo said, \u201cpolice usually know what\u2019s going on. The question is, why do they choose to act at a certain time?\u201d He conjectured that morality policing before the holy month of Ramadan, which started last week, was one potential factor.\nLast week in Bandung, the capital of West Java, provincial police chief Charliyan told reporters that LGBT people suffered a \"disease of the body and soul.\u201d\nBut a spokesman for the national police, Setyo Wasisto, said there were no plans to scale up the West Java task force on a national level.\n\u201cThe duty of the police to enforce the rules and laws so that everyone has the same rights,\u201d said Yuli Rustinawati, chair of the LGBT activist group Arus Pelangi. \u201cNot to be moral police.\u201d\nA checkered history\nLast October, Indonesian President Joko \u201cJokowi\u201d Widodo gave an extremely qualified defense of LGBT rights after months of anti-gay rhetoric. He denounced discrimination against gay Indonesians after asserting that \u201cin Indonesia, beliefs [generally] do not allow [homosexuality], Islam does not allow it.\u201d\nFILE - Indonesian president-elect Joko Widodo gestures as he speaks to his supporters during a gathering in Jakarta.\nGay rights are an uncomfortable topic in Indonesian public life, said Oetomo. \u201cThere is no advocacy at the highest level in Jakarta. My sense is that if the rights of governors and chief of police are willing to do something, they\u2019ll do it quietly.\u201d\nThe spike in anti-LGBT attacks follows the rising profile of one of the most virulent anti-gay voices in Indonesia, the Islamic Defenders\u2019 Front (FPI), the hardline group that organized the rallies against Jakarta\u2019s governor last year. FPI-associated vigilantes filmed the gay couple who was caned in Aceh, and FPI has promised to \u201chelp\u201d Indonesian police conduct further raids like the ones in Jakarta and Surabaya.\nBut a sexting scandal involving its leader, Habib Rizieq Shihab, degrades some of the authority by which FPI has unofficially acted as Indonesia\u2019s morality police since its founding in 1998. It is not clear if his recent arrest will lead to a respite in the LGBT crackdown.\nAn uncertain future\n\u201cThis feels like a repeat, in a way,\u201d said Fajar Zakhri, a 25-year-old gay man who lives in Jakarta and who lived through last year\u2019s LGBT crackdown. \u201cBut it's a worse repeat. Because the [recent] events sort of overlapped with one another and you can just sense this overall spirit of... they want to criminalize us.\u201d\nFILE - In this Nov. 11, 2016 photo, contestants wait backstage during the Miss Transgender Indonesia pageant in Jakarta, Indonesia.\nIt hasn\u2019t always been so in Indonesia. Transgender people, including the waria \u201cthird-gender\u201d people, have long been a part of Indonesian societies. One Sulawesi group, the Bugis people, historically recognize five genders.\nThe worst development for LGBT rights, meanwhile, is still on the table: a Constitutional Court petition banning homosexual acts between consenting adults. It was filed last May and remains an open question.\nIn the same week that Taiwan became the first Asian country to move towards formal recognition of same-sex marriage, the proposed anti-gay ban is a sobering prospect for Indonesia\u2019s LGBT community.\n\n            ",

Refugee Agency and the International Organization for Migration said they hope the \"U.S. will continue its strong leadership role and long tradition of protecting those who are fleeing conflict and persecution.\" The agencies said they \"strongly believe that refugees should receive equal treatment for protection and assistance, and opportunities for resettlement, regardless of their religion, nationality or race.\"\nTrump signed the order Friday at the Pentagon where he participated in a swearing-in ceremony for Defense Secretary James Mattis. Soon after the president's action protesters staged a demonstration at the main federal office building in New York.\nAs a reason for the order, the document cites the September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington, which were carried out by 19 foreigners who obtained visas to enter the United States without difficulty. It refers to other terrorism-related crimes committed over the past 15 years by foreign nationals who entered the United States using either short-term visas - as visitors, students or temporary workers - or as refugees seeking resettlement in the U.S.\nMotaz Alafandi of Syria shows a photo he keeps on his smartphone of his daughter Yara, 18, who lives in Montreal, Jan. 27, 2017, in Garland, Texas. Alafandi, a 49-year-old Syrian lives in Dallas while seeking asylum with his wife and three youngest children, ages 14, 11 and 5. \"I wish that Mr. President (Trump) can help in stopping the war in Syria,\" said Alafandi, who said he loves the U.S. and the American people but does hope to return one day to his homeland.\nAverting attacks\n\"Deteriorating conditions in certain countries due to war, strife, disaster and civil unrest increase the likelihood that terrorists will use any means possible to entered the United States,\" the order states, and it calls for greater vigilance and caution by American consular officials before visas are granted.\nThe order does not spell out which countries are \"of particular concern,\" although it authorizes the Department of Homeland Security to keep track of nations that do not provide adequate information about their citizens. White House officials indicated earlier this week that Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia would be an initial list of countries \"of concern,\" but the order noted additions to the list could be made at any time.\nAs reported earlier when drafts of Trump's planned action circulated in Washington several days ago, the official text forbids the entry into the United States of any Syrian refugees for an indefinite period, until the president determines \"that sufficient changes have been made ... to ensure that admission of Syrian refugees is consistent with the national interest.\"\nThe order also suspends operations of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days, while the Secretary of State and other officials reevaluate procedures \"to ensure that those approved for refugee admission do not pose a threat to the security and welfare of the United States.\" It also limits the number of refugees that may be admitted to the United States to 50,000 during fiscal 2017, the 12-month period that ends on September 30.\nDescription: Protesters chant slogans against President Donald Trump's executive order on Muslim immigration, Thursday, Jan. 26, 2017, in downtown Miami. The protesters manifested their opposition to Trump's executive order restricting immigration from some Muslim-majority nations.\nWho will be affected?\nThe president said Friday that only people who support the United States should be allowed into the country. The executive order he signed discussed identification and verification procedures that U.S. consular officers should use in extensive detail.\nUnder the general topic of terrorism, the executive order directed U.S. officials to watch for \"gender-based violence against women, including 'honor killings,\" and called for the gathering of \"any other information relevant to public safety and security.\"\n\"We don't want them here,\" said Trump. \"We want to make sure that we are not admitting into our country the very threats our soldiers are fighting overseas. We only want to admit those into our country who will support our country and love deeply our people.\"\nPeter Brookes, a senior fellow of national security affairs at Heritage Foundation, said the ban is \u201cessentially a pause\u201d being used by the new administration to review past programs and policies. He said it was an important step needed to avoid \u201cthe problems that we have seen Europe suffer at hands of people who have either been recent refugees or come in posing as refugees.\u201d\nBrookes noted that recent gains made by coalition forces fighting against the Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq are putting pressure on the Islamic extremists, making it more likely they might try to flee to other countries.\n\u201cI think ISIS is in crisis. It is under significant pressure in both Mosul and Raqqa. The caliphate is going to crumble at some point in the future and those fighters are going to go somewhere. They may try to return home or may try to go to other countries,\u201d he said.\nOthers say the threat of terrorism from refugees is overblown, however, and the U.S. has a duty to accept people from these war-torn countries.\n\u201cThere is really a very limited risk of refugees committing crimes or acts of terrorism and there is a lot of statistics about that,\u201d Benjamin Friedman, a research fellow in defense and homeland security studies at the CATO institute, said. \u201cParticularly with regards to Iraq, Libya and to a lesser extent Syria I think the United States has a unique responsibility to accept immigrants refugees included because we helped destabilize those countries.\u201d\nMark Hetfield of the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, added, \"It's clear that President Trump has decided to pick on refugees. ... This is going to cost tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of people their lives, because they won't find protection here. They won't find protection anywhere.\"\nSyrian refugees Dania Khatib, 5, with her mother Mahasen Boshnaq, rear, holding her brother Mohammed, 1, sits in the home of their sponsoring family, Jan. 27, 2017, in Rutland, Vt.

And certainly, if there is a claim that those constitutional rights are being violated by an executive order, that claim would go to the U.S. Supreme Court.\"\nA Syrian asylum-seeker told VOA \u201crefuges are victims, not terrorists.\u201d\n\u201cI applied for asylum from inside the U.S. in late 2014. I've been in the process for more than two years and I didn't get my asylum yet. That shows how long the vetting process is and how stringent the security checks are,\u201d said Middle East Institute resident fellow Ibrahim Al Assil.\n\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s suspension of the U.S. Refugee Admission Program for 120 days and indefinite halt of refugee processing and admittance of Syrian refugees is in disregard for human rights,\u201d added Assil who co-founded the Syrian Nonviolence Movement, \u201cthis is a fundamental violation of the right to seek asylum in accordance with the 1951 Refugee Convention.\u201d\nThe 1951 Refugee Convention is the key document that defines the term \u201crefugee\u201d and outlines the rights of the displaced, as well as the legal obligations of States to protect them.\nPolicy review\nAlso Friday, Trump signed a presidential memorandum directed at the new secretary of defense and the Office of Budget Management, outlining their responsibilities for evaluating the nation's security policies.\nAn executive memorandum differs from an executive order in that it is directed at a specific federal agency. An executive order is always entered into the Federal Register, the official daily journal of U.S. government activity. While memoranda may not be formally recorded in the Federal Register, both types of presidential action carry the force of law.\nTrump said the memorandum regarding national security was intended to better support the U.S. military.\n\"Believe me,\" the president said, \"first I'm signing an executive action to begin a great rebuilding of the armed services of the United States, developing a plan for new planes, new ships, new resources, and new tools for our men and women in uniform. And I'm very proud to be doing that.\"\nThe memorandum, proclaiming a policy of pursuing \"peace through strength,\" said the new secretary must conduct a 30-day readiness review assessing training, equipment maintenance, munitions, modernization, and infrastructure of the current armed forces. It tasks the new secretary with submitting to the president a report and a plan within 60 days, identifying actions that can be implemented within the current fiscal years to improve readiness.\nThe memorandum says Mattis must initiate a new Nuclear Posture Review to make sure the U.S. nuclear deterrent is \"modern, robust, flexible, resilient, ready, and appropriately tailored to deter 21st-century threats and reassure\" U.S. allies.\nVOA's Nike Ching, Fern Robinson and Hasib Alikozai contributed to this report.\n\n            ",

In a statement, the officials said Tilikum had faced serious health issues including a persistent and complicated bacterial lung infection. He was estimated to be 36 years old. A necropsy will be performed, according to the statement.\nThe 2010 death of SeaWorld trainer Dawn Brancheau during a performance with Tilikum after a ``Dine with Shamu'' show shocked the public and changed the future of orcas at SeaWorld parks.\nBrancheau was interacting with Tilikum before a live audience at SeaWorld Orlando when he pulled her from a platform by her arm and held her underwater. An autopsy report said Brancheau drowned but also suffered severe trauma, including multiple fractures.\nOrca breeding progam, shows stop \nSeaWorld Entertainment officials announced in March 2016 that the tourist attraction would end its orca breeding program and theatrical shows involving killer whales.\nWhile the breeding program continued, Tilikum was SeaWorld's most prolific male orca, siring 14 calves during his time at SeaWorld Orlando. He arrived at the park about 25 years ago.\nHe was noticeable for his size at more than 22 feet and 11,800 pounds.\n\u201cTilikum had, and will continue to have, a special place in the hearts of the SeaWorld family, as well as the millions of people all over the world that he inspired,\u201d SeaWorld President and CEO Joel Manby said. \u201cMy heart goes out to our team who cared for him like family.\u201d\nBorn near Iceland\nTilikum was born off the waters of Iceland and moved to Sealand of the Pacific in Canada after being captured. While at Sealand in 1992, Tilikum and two female orcas were responsible for the death of a part-time trainer who slipped and fell into their pool and was submerged by them.\nTilikum was moved to SeaWorld Orlando a short time later, and Sealand later closed.\nThe decision to end the SeaWorld breeding program and theatrical shows came six years after Brancheau's death and three years after the release of the documentary, ``Blackfish,'' which chronicled Tilikum's life and Brancheau's death.\nHer death was not the only one linked to Tillikum at SeaWorld. In 1999, a naked man who had eluded security and sneaked into SeaWorld at night was found dead the next morning draped over Tilikum in a breeding tank in the back of Shamu Stadium.\nPark attendance dips \nThe \u201cBlackfish\u201d documentary argued that killer whales, when in captivity, become more aggressive toward humans and each other. After the documentary played at the Sundance Film Festival and aired on CNN, several entertainers pulled out of planned performances at SeaWorld parks and animal rights activists increased their demonstrations outside the parks.\nAttendance at SeaWorld parks dipped, the company faced falling profits and Southwest Airlines ended its 25-year relationship with the theme park company.\nIn March, SeaWorld CEO acknowledged that the public's attitude had changed about keeping killer whales captive and that the company would end its orca breeding program.\n\u201cWe needed to move where society was moving,\u201d Manby said.\n\n            ",

McMaster, told interviewers that at a May 10 White House meeting with two Russian diplomats, Trump brought up Comey's ouster the day before in an effort to show how \"distracted\" he had been by Comey's investigation of possible Trump campaign collusion with Moscow interests to help him win the election.\nU.S. President Donald Trump meets with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, left, next to Russian Ambassador to the U.S. Sergei Kislyak at the White House in Washington, May 10, 2017. (Russian Foreign Ministry photo via AP)\nAccording to a New York Times report Friday, Trump told Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Moscow's U.S. ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, that Comey was \"a real nutjob\" and that his removal would relieve \"great pressure.\" Some opposition Democratic lawmakers say that Trump's dismissal of the official investigating him amounts to obstruction of justice, an impeachable offense.\nAnother Times story said Comey's notes from a February meeting with Trump the day after he fired his first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, showed that he urged Comey to drop his probe of Flynn's calls to Kislyak.\nMcMaster told ABC, \"The gist of the conversation was that the president feels as if he is hamstrung in his ability to work with Russia to find areas of cooperation because this has been obviously so much in the news.\"\nTillerson told Fox News that Trump was also trying to convey to the Russians that he was \"not going to be distracted by all these issues at home that affect us domestically.\"\nRepublican Senator John McCain, a frequent Trump critic, told Fox News that he was \"almost speechless\" that Trump would describe Comey in such negative terms. The White House has not denied Trump's attack on Comey while condemning leaks of the Oval Office meeting.\n\"I don't know why someone would say something like that,\" McCain said, but stopped short of saying Comey's firing was an effort to impede the FBI's investigation.\n\"I don't think it was a wise thing to do,\" McCain said. \"Mr. Comey was highly respected and highly regarded and so I can't explain it.\"\nFILE - In this April 21, 2016 file photo, attorney and former FBI Director Robert Mueller, right, arrives for a court hearing at the Phillip Burton Federal Building in San Francisco.\nEven with Trump dismissing Comey, Robert Mueller, Comey's predecessor as director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the country's top law enforcement agency, was named this past week as special prosecutor to investigate Russia's meddling in the election and whether any Trump aides colluded with Moscow to boost Trump's chances of defeating his Democratic challenger, Hillary Clinton.\nThe U.S. intelligence community has concluded Moscow hacked into the computer of Clinton campaign chief John Podesta, with the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks subsequently releasing thousands of his emails in the weeks just before last November's election, depicting embarrassing behind-the-scenes efforts by Democratic operatives to help Clinton win the party's presidential nomination.\nAnother Republican lawmaker, Senator Marco Rubio, said, \"If any president tries to impede an investigation ... no matter who it is, by interfering with the FBI, yes, that would be problematic.

Thankfully they invited some cameras along, too, with the help of Funny or Die and the Primetime Emmy Award-winning \u201cYears of Living Dangerously.\u201d\nThe fruits of their conversations can be seen in the digital series \u201cBoiling the Frog with Senator Al Franken.\u201d Their talks run the gamut from serious to funny as they take on everything from coal and carbon prices to Letterman's retirement beard in the six 5-minute shorts that begin rolling out Monday on funnyordie.com and its Facebook page with a new installment each week.\nFor Sen. Franken, it's an effort to \u201cfight back\u201d against the creeping apathy and disregard toward science and climate change.\n\u201cSince taking office, President Trump has decided to disregard science in order to repeatedly put the short-sighted interests of his friends in the fossil fuel industry ahead of the safety of our planet,\u201d Franken said. \u201cWe hope to bring some much needed attention to this critical issue and ultimately, to help encourage people in Minnesota, Dave's home state of Indiana and all Americans to make their voices heard and join the fight to combat climate change.\u201d\nLetterman recently did an episode of \u201cYears of Living Dangerously\u201d in which he traveled to India to learn about what the country is doing about power and climate.\nHe said he would \u201cdo anything on this topic\u201d and \u201canything for Al.\u201d\n\u201cHe gives me hope, he gives me faith,\u201d Letterman said.\nLetterman also spoke to The Associated Press about late-night television in the Trump era and jokes about the president that cross the line.\nThe remarks have been edited for clarity and brevity.\nAP: What do you hope to accomplish with this series?\nLetterman: To me, people ought to be aware of this, people ought to have this tucked in their wallet. People ought to walk around with this every day in the back of their mind and people ought to be aware and be educated and looking forward to things that they might do to help their kids and their children's kids. I think it's better in that regard than it used to be - the current administration notwithstanding. When you travel places and I know in California the same thing is true, you see enormous solar installations, you see enormous wind farms that 10 years ago did not exist. I am aware firsthand through traveling here and abroad that people are aware of this and doing things about it.\nAP: Speaking of the current administration, late-night seems to have become mostly Trump jokes and tirades. Do you miss not being part of that?\nLetterman: Here's what I keep saying: We know there's something wrong, but what I'm tired of is people, daily, nightly, on all the cable news shows telling us there's something wrong. I just think we ought to direct our resources and our energies to doing something about it. And other people have made this point: If the guy was running Dairy Queen, he'd be gone. This guy couldn't work at The Gap. So why do we have to be victimized by his fecklessness, his ignorance? But it's just the behavior is insulting to Americans, whether you voted for him or not - and I feel bad for people who did vote for him because he promised them things that they really needed and one wonders if he's really going to come through.\nI know there's trouble in this country and we need a guy who can fix that trouble. I wish it was Trump, but it's not, so let's just stop whining about what a goon he is and figure out a way to take him aside and put him in a home.\nAP: Sen. Franken had been critical of Kathy Griffin for how she spoke out. Do you think she took it too far?\nLetterman: As you and I know, you can make jokes about anything. But you have to be prepared to answer the criticism so that's just what that was. She made a joke. Others have made jokes that were better or worse. And she just had to answer for it. ... I felt bad for her. I would not have made the joke. I think and say things to my friends that are worse. But he's so sensitive. He doesn't understand why people aren't nicer to him in the press and you just say, well, `Donnie, look at the tone of the campaign that you ran.'\nAP: In one of the episodes you tell Sen. Franken that you're constantly looking for a version of his life where what you do is truly meaningful. Do you feel like you've been able to accomplish that in your retirement?\nLetterman: No, no, and it frustrates me. I'll tell you the climate situation and gun control makes me crazy. And the fact that 30 million people in this country are hungry every day. The answer to your question, the long and the short of it, is no, and I find it deeply, deeply frustrating. That's why I would do anything with Al, I would go anywhere with Al. Because on the other hand, I always wondered about what it looked like when a celebrity got up and talked about people who didn't have shoelaces, but it's killing me. And I think Al to a certain extent felt that same frustration. He's figured out a way to do it and it's been successful. And the guy is superfunny, superintelligent and the integrity just seeps out from under his door.\nAnd one more thing: If Nat Geo or anybody else would like a project and they need a stooge, I would be first in line.\n\n            ",

The education secretary read portions of a Dr. Seuss classic, Oh, the Places You'll Go, to the children.\nDeVos' visit last month to a public school in Washington, just a short distance from her offices at the Department of Education, also was met with protesters, who briefly barred her from entering the building.\nThe billionaire philanthropist was considered an unconventional pick for education secretary. Although she has been involved in education policy for nearly three decades, she never attended, worked for or administered a public school system.\nProtesters gather outside Jefferson Middle School in Washington, Feb. 10, 2017, where Education Secretary Betsy DeVos paid her first visit as education secretary in a bid to mend fences with educators after a bruising confirmation battle.\n'Advocate for children'\nShe describes herself as \u201can advocate for children and a voice for parents,\u201d and is \u201cespecially passionate about reforms that help underserved children gain access to a quality education.\u201d\nDeVos has long championed a policy of school choice, which allows parents to choose freely whether their children attend traditional public schools, private schools or \u201ccharter schools\u201d \u2014 independent schools operating under contract with a public school network, supported by public funds.\nCritics say DeVos' policies encourage further privatization of education in American cities and towns and undermine the public school system.\n\u201cI am very concerned about her approach to providing vouchers to people who are putting their kids in private schools or religious schools, or schools where there is little or no oversight,\u201d said Heidi Bumper, who joined Thursday's demonstration.\n\u201cWe need to support our public schools and provide funding for our public school educations,\u201d Bumper added, \u201cfor all kids.\u201d\nEducation Secretary Betsy DeVos listens as President Donald Trump speaks during a round table discussion at Saint Andrew Catholic School, March 3, 2017, in Orlando, Florida.\nChurch-state issues a concern\nOpponents of privatization contend that diverting billions of taxpayer dollars from public schools to Christian and Catholic institutions, which make up the majority of private schools in the United States, also raises concerns about the traditional American separation of church and state affairs.\nDeVos' supporters say greater choice in schools and more voucher plans can provide a lifeline for parents whose children are enrolled in underperforming schools and districts \u2014 those where student test scores and achievements are below average \u2014 and also give public educators an incentive to produce better results.\n\u201cIf schools had to compete for students, they'd have better outcomes,\u201d Carderock parent Ann Moore said.\n\u201cI think the problem is the [teachers] unions,\u201d Moore said, \u201cand I think Secretary DeVos has the right idea \u2014 minimizing the impact of the unions on education and giving parents the right to choose, especially in inner-city schools and poor performing schools in rural areas.

Talks between the NATO allies reportedly focused on Washington's support for Syrian Kurdish militias in the fight against the Islamic State group.\nThe United States says it chooses carefully among Kurdish fighters when lending its support to Syrian rebels battling Islamic State. Ankara dismisses the Americans' arguments and says they are actively supporting the People's Protection Units, the YPG, whose fighters the Turks contend are terrorists group united with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, fighting against the Turkish state.\n\u201cTurkey has made its view on this organization (YPG) very clear,\u201d says political columnist Semih Idiz of Al Monitor, \u201cand any step back at this moment would entail a loss of face for the government in Ankara and of course indirectly for President (Recep Tayyip) Erdogan.\u201d\n'Ultimate issue for Turkey'\n\u201cIt is the ultimate issue for Turkey, and if there is no movement as far as Turkey's requests and demands, it seems that this crisis issue between the two countries will remain,\u201d Idiz added.\nU.S. Vice President Mike Pence likely will hear the same message when he discusses the fight against Islamic State on Saturday in Germany with Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim. The two will hold talks on the sidelines of the annual Munich Security Conference.\nThe United States and European Union agree on the PKK, which both have designated a terrorist organization. Washington maintains its military does not assist the PKK but does support the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) a coalition of Syrian Arabs and Kurds that has proven itself to be by far the most effective force against Islamic State extremists in Syria.\nThe SDF is a multiethnic and multireligious alliance of militia fighters opposed to the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad, but its military leadership comes from the YPG, and that is what has drawn Turkey's intense opposition.\nA Kurdish fighter from the People's Protection Units (YPG) carries his weapons as he walks the streets in the northeastern city of Hasaka, Syria, Aug. 21, 2016.\nAnkara wants YPG sidelined\nSupport from U.S. and European special forces, along with American air power, has enabled the SDF to advance to within a few kilometers of Raqqa, the large Syrian city that is the jihadists' self-declared capital.\n\u201cThe bulk of the forces advancing on Raqqa are Arabs, but I say the bulk of the forces, not all the forces. The Arab and Kurds (of SDF) actually work hand in glove (together),\u201d British Lieutenant-General Rupert Jones said in a press briefing this week by the international coalition against Islamic State. \u201cAnd my expectation is, if the SDF is the assault force into Raqqa, that is how they will operate; they will work together in concert with each other.\u201d\nExperts say such comments are infuriating to Ankara, which has been intensely lobbying Washington to exclude the Syrian Kurdish militia from plans to capture Raqqa. Earlier this week, Defense Minister Fikri Isik declared Washington was moving closer to the Turkish position, after word came that the Pentagon is working on an action plan to defeat Islamic State, as ordered by President Donald Trump.\nAnalysts point out that Ankara has so far failed to provide Washington a detailed alternate plan to using the Syrian Kurdish militia.\nTurkey's Defence Minister Fikri Isik answers a question during an interview in Ankara, Aug. 5, 2016.\nRaqqa mystery\n\u201cThis is the big mystery, because obviously, to have an operation against Raqqa, you are going to need a massive amount of ground troops,\u201d said columnist Idiz. \u201cIt's not clear what Turkey is offering and how it's planning to make up for the absence of the YPG forces, should they somehow be weeded out by the American side. So none of this has been clearly spelled out.\u201d\n\u201cI don't think personally that the American side and the allies supporting the Americans are going to change horses midstream unless there is some guarantee on what Turkey can do,\u201d Idiz added.\nExperts warn Ankara is finding itself increasingly isolated over its stance of absolute opposition to the YPG and its political wing, the PYD. \u201cTurkey has a very weak hand,\u201d warns international relations specialist Soli Ozel of Istanbul's Kadir Has University.\nOzel, who says Ankara could temper its hostility, pointed out that Erdogan reaffirmed his position that the YPG is nothing but a terrorist organization after a meeting he had earlier this month with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.\nAnkara still has some cards to play with Washington, since Turkey shares a long border with Syria and U.S. forces depend on Turkish airbases for operations against IS.\nRegional experts warn Ankara could also play spoiler to U.S. military plans to capture Raqqa, by sending Turkish military forces toward the Syrian town of Manbij. The town was liberated by Syrian Kurdish forces from Islamic State, and any battle for its control could see the YPG pulling out of an offensive against Raqqa in order to defend it.\n\n            ",

Mujuru denies the charges.\nMugabe has ruled the former British colony since independence in 1980. He turns 93 on Feb. 21 and has been confirmed as the ZANU-PF presidential candidate for the vote which is due in 2018.\nLast year Mujuru formed her own political party to challenge Mugabe, raising hopes that a politician who had liberation war credentials and enjoyed the support of some military generals could successfully challenge Mugabe.\nThe poor showing in Bikita West, which was marked by high voter turnout, comes at a time Mujuru is negotiation with the main opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) on a coalition pact to take on Mugabe in next year's election.\nThe MDC led by Morgan Tsvangirai did not contest Saturday's vote in keeping with its decision to boycott all elections because it argues the election environment favors the ruling party.\nZANU-PF is the dominant party in parliament where it has 221 out of 270 seats in the lower house.\nMujuru could not be reached for comment on Sunday.

Beijing blocked a similar proposal last year.\nLast month, the United States, backed by France and Britain, initiated another move to blacklist Azhar, but China has put the proposal on hold, effectively blocking it.\nChina has defended its latest move, saying conditions have not yet been met to back the proposal on Azhar, and that it had taken the step to allow a consensus representing the international community.\nBilateral implications\nAnalysts in New Delhi say the issue has become a huge irritant for India and is casting a shadow on ties between the two Asian nations. \n\u201cObviously it will impact on bilateral relations, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d said Srikanth Kondapalli, a professor of Chinese Studies at New Delhi\u2019s Jawaharlal Nehru University.\nIndian Foreign Ministry spokesman Vikas Swarup countered by saying that \u201cif there is a change in the Chinese position, there will be consensus also.\u201d He added that, \u201cwe hope that eventually China will also come around to accepting this view.\u201d\nIndia says China is the only country on the 15-member U.N. Security Council holding out on the proposal.\nIndia accuses Jaish-e-Mohammad and its leader, Maulana Masood Azhar, of masterminding several deadly attacks in India, including an assault on an air force base last year. Pakistan says it has found no evidence linking him to the January 2014 attack.\nThe Jaish-e-Mohammad group that Azhar heads has been blacklisted by the United Nations. If Azhar is blacklisted by the U.N. Security Council, he would face a global travel ban and asset freeze.\nIndia's nuclear desires\nBesides the continuing differences on the issue of Azhar, India is also upset by China\u2019s opposition to its entry to the main club of countries controlling access to sensitive nuclear technology.\nAlthough India is a not a signatory of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the United States has been pushing for India to join the elite Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG). But China says exceptions should not be made for one country.\nAnalysts in New Delhi see Beijing\u2019s longstanding ties with Pakistan as the reason it\u2019s blocking the move on Azhar and on India\u2019s entry to the NSG.\n\u201cWhy are the Chinese dragging their feet on the issue? This move appears quite strange for the Indian side. Of course there is speculation that China is backing Pakistan,\u201d Kondapalli said.\nHe says the promise of improved ties after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi took power about three years ago has not materialized. \n\u201cThere is a cooling off that has happened in the last one, one and a half years, now,\u201d he said.\n\n            ",

Chinese President Xi Jinping frequently talks about what he says is an effort to \"tell China\u2019s story well\" - to tell its story on its own terms.\nBeijing aims to portray China as \"a civilization that is ancient, rich,\" said Clayton Dube, director of the University of Southern California\u2019s U.S.-China Institute.\n\"With China's advanced economic strength, it's been able to invest mightily in developing modern communication technologies, investing heavily in broadcast, investing heavily in internet, websites and news-gathering and these sorts of things, but also investing in the Confucius Institutes to try to increase American understanding of China,\" he said.\nSome of this is being done openly through state media broadcasts overseas such as China Central Television, recently rebranded as China Global Television Network, or CGTN. It also comes in the form of \"advertorials\" in leading American newspapers.\nIn other cases, covertly.\nOn campuses, there are Confucius Institutes, the more than 100 Chinese language and learning centers that have a growing physical presence at universities and institutes of higher learning in the United States.\nFILE - Chinese President Hu Jintao visits the The Confucius Institute which is housed at Walter Payton College Preparatory High School in Chicago, Friday, Jan. 21, 2011.\nThe centers claim to be a non-governmental organization, but administratively, its parent group falls under China\u2019s Ministry of Education. And in recent years, several have been shut down over concerns about transparency and the impact they were having on academic freedom.\nPhilip Clart, Director of the University of Leipzig\u2019s Confucius Institute and Professor of Chinese Studies at its Department of East Asian Studies, argues that when it comes to Confucius Institutes, they can be beneficial if handled correctly.\nClart said that while censorship and free speech issues remain a concern, these are not necessarily inherent to the program and can be avoided if there is a clear functional and institutional separation between the program and the university.\nHowever, \"if you are at a place where you don\u2019t have an independent Chinese or Asian studies department, where the [Confucius Institutes] is brought to actually for the first time offer anything, any Chinese instruction, and there is no other voice, this becomes more difficult.\"\nPackaging authoritarianism\nChinese student groups are also a growing force that at times are seen as forwarding the Communist Party\u2019s agenda overseas. For example, when Tibet\u2019s exiled spiritual leader the Dalai Lama was invited to speak at the University of California, San Diego in June, a group of Chinese students at the university launched a protest to stop his speech.\nAs the group rallied against the invitation, arguing strangely enough that the invitation to the Dalai Lama goes against \"diversity\" and \"political correctness,\" its connections to the local Chinese consulate were thrust into the limelight.\nThat incident and others highlight the difficulties Beijing faces and how the line between telling the China story well and spreading the Communist Party\u2019s propaganda can easily blur.\nFILE - A security guard walks past the logo for China Central Television (now China Global Television Network) in Beijing Thursday, Aug. 24, 2006.\nMedia inroads\nA Reuters investigation in 2015 uncovered that more than a dozen stations across the United States were airing programming from state broadcaster China Radio International in the United States.\nAnd while reaching an English speaking audience may be difficult, analysts note that the Communist Party has made major inroads when it comes to Chinese language media in the U.S.\nWhile under the radar for most part, much of the landscape is Beijing-controlled or aligned. It targets mostly ethnic Chinese who may also be exposed to English coverage, but it shapes and in some ways limits the information they receive.\nUltimately, the goal for the Communist Party is for it \"to be accepted as effective, legitimate and good,\" said Robert Daly, director of the Kissinger Institute on China and the United States at the Woodrow Wilson Center. But selling one-party authoritarianism is a \"pretty difficult pitch.\"\n\"People listen to China, people know China is important, but they (Beijing) really don\u2019t have a good story to tell that would convince Americans that one-party authoritarianism is, in fact, okay,\" Daly said.\nKowtowing to profits\nThe biggest challenge of them all, however, is when \"American architects of soft power cave in to Beijing for money,\" said Daly.\nThis is most commonly seen in Hollywood, but also in publishing and even gaming. In some cases, content that might in some way be undesirable to Beijing gets scrapped to ensure access to China\u2019s market.\n\"Because the size of the Chinese film market is so large, everybody wants a part of it.

Several public buses and cargo trucks were torched in Rio de Janeiro on Tuesday.\nCrime on the rise after budget cuts\nThe criticism comes as public security forces, grappling with budget cuts after two years of recession in Latin America's biggest country, also contend with rebounding crime.\nIn Rio, where the state government last year slashed the public security budget by more than a third, criminal gangs are battling for lucrative access to drug routes and sales points.\nGangs are also fighting to take back turf that police had occupied in the runup to the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Olympics, both of which Rio hosted.\nClashes between police and criminals in recent months have led to prolonged firefights and multiple deaths \u2014 in slums and rich neighborhoods alike.

The success of the talks now carries with it potentially far reaching energy implications for the region, involving Turkey, Israel and the European Union.\nIsrael and Turkey are in talks to develop a major pipeline that would exploit the massive Leviathan gas reserves discovered off the Israel coast.\n\u201cThe best possible exploitation of the Israeli offshore facility would be through Turkey and its transfer to European Union, which would enhance the energy security of the European Union,\u201d pointed out retired Turkish ambassador Unal Cevikoz, now head of the think tank Ankara Policy Center. The EU has long been looking to diversify its dependance on Russian gas.\nThe catch is that such a pipeline from Israel to Turkey would have to pass through Cyprus or Cypriot waters. \u201cIt's only possible if Cyprus is also added into this equation, it has to become an Israel-Turkey-Cyprus trilateral cooperation. Now as long as the Cypriot problem is pending, unresolved, then it remains a big question whether we can proceed (with the pipeline) in that sense,\u201d said Cevikoz.\nTurkey's President Tayyip Erdogan talks to media after the Eid al-Fitr prayers in Istanbul, June 25, 2017.\nRegional energy hub\nThe Israel gas pipeline is part of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's strategic goal of turning Turkey into a regional energy hub. Along with obvious financial gains from transit fees, it would enhance Turkey as a powerful energy player in the region.\nTurkish Energy minister Berat Albayrak was reported in Turkish media saying he communicated via WhatsApp nearly everyday with senior Israel energy officials about the project. The pipeline is potentially the most important fruit of a rapprochement efforts between the countries since a collapse in relations after Israeli commandos killed nine Turks seeking to break Israel's sea blockade in 2010.\n\u201cThe pipeline for gas to Turkey is an export opportunity for Israel. Israeli gas could be in Turkey within two to three years,\u201d predicted Israel's General Director of National Infrastructure, Energy & Water Ministry Shaul Meridor, speaking in April this year at the Atlantic Council Istanbul Summit.\nGrowing speculation\nThe incentives from taking a giant leap toward its energy hub aspirations has led to growing speculation that Ankara could be prepared to make major concessions in the latest Cypriot reunification talks. Turkey, along with Greece and the United Kingdom, are guarantor powers for the island. Turkey's large military presence on the island remains a key obstacle to unification efforts.\n\u201cThere is a climate that people are a little more positive vis-a-vis Cyprus than they were in the past,\u201d observed Al Monitor columnist Semih Idiz. He remains skeptical, however, that energy interests can provide sufficient impetus for a breakthrough.\n\u201cPersonally having followed this (Cyprus unification efforts) for 40 years, I am not optimistic,\u201d said Idiz. \u201cI think they (gas pipelines) are very important, I think Ankara is eyeing those. But I don't think you will get any government in Turkey to conceding on Turkey's traditional and strategic interests in Cyprus for the sake of energy interests. Cyprus is a nationalist cause.\"\nIndeed, Erdogan is increasingly courting Turkish nationalist voters ahead of presidential elections in 2019. Israel appears to be making contingency plans. In April it signed a preliminary deal with the Greek Cypriot and Italian governments to construct a pipeline to transport Eastern Mediterranean gas to Europe.\nBut an Israel-Greece-Italy pipeline is predicted to be the longest, most expensive and challenging of its kind.\nThe 'Pioneering Spirit' vessel crosses the Bosphorus Strait in Istanbul, May 31, 2017. The strait was closed to traffic due to the transiting of the vessel, which will carry out the construction of a Turkish natural gas offshore pipeline.\nU.S. has role\n\u201cTo try build a pipeline though the Mediterranean, to Greece and to the Italian market, is very expensive and not commercially viable, it won\u2019t work,\u201d said Mithat Rende, a retired Turkish ambassador and an expert on Eastern Mediterranean energy.\nRende points out that with a U.S. company involved in developing the Israel gas field, since Washington has an incentive to use its muscle to make a breakthrough and to help shore up the strategic gain of cementing ties between key regional allies Turkey and Israel, \"there will be no need for the consent of the Greek Cypriots.\"\nThe Greek Cypriot government is the only internationally recognized administration on the island that likely would contest any pipeline using Cypriot waters without its consent, resulting in lengthy international litigation \u2014 a prospect any pipeline constructor would be keen to avoid. Ankara's pipeline aspirations seem destined to be tied to the success of the latest U.N.-sponsored efforts to reunite the divided island.\n\n            ",

The main reason, the report found, is a drop in oil prices.\n\u201cThe sharp decreases in oil prices has affected quite a number of African countries, namely South Sudan and Angola. This has kind of driven almost the entire regional trend,\u201d said Nan Tian, a researcher at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute\u2019s (SIPRI) Arms and Military Expenditure Program, the organization that authored the report.\nThe SIPRI report found military spending in Africa in 2016 was down by 1.3 percent from the previous year and totaled about $37.9 billion.\nDespite the drop, Africa\u2019s military spending remains 48 percent higher than it was a decade ago. \u201cA few of the top spenders within these regions are generally oil economies, so the low oil prices have meant sharp cutbacks in government financing and that includes military spending,\u201d he said.\nSome of Africa\u2019s biggest spenders in recent years have included oil-rich Angola, which has sought to modernize its air force and navy, and Algeria which has tried to preserve its stability amid the collapse of Libya and the rise of extremism in North Africa. Both of those countries have slowed spending recently, Tian said.\nFILE - Nigerian soldiers ride on the armored vehicle in Maiduguri, Nigeria, Aug. 8, 2013. Nigeria is among the few African countries that have increased their military budgets in recent years.\nWeighing spending against needs\nTian said that perhaps the most important question to ask, is whether military spending in Africa is at appropriate levels.\nTen African countries have military expenditures greater than 3 percent of their GDP. The highest are the Republic of the Congo where military expenditures totaled 7 percent of GDP in 2016, and Algeria where military spending totaled 6.7 percent of GDP.\nGlobally, military spending is 2.2 percent of GDP or about $227 per person.\n\u201cYou have the security aspect also in Africa. We have the opportunity costs,\u201d Tian said. \u201cIt is the poorest continent. The question is: should this continent be spending? Are they spending enough or are they spending too much on military based on their current income levels? Should they rather be prioritizing other aspects of spending maybe health care, maybe education, maybe infrastructure?\u201d\nNot all African countries saw a decline in military spending. According to the report, Botswana\u2019s military spending grew by 40 percent, or about $152 million. Botswana is regularly noted for having a long record of peace and good governance, and is undergoing a military modernization program.\nNigeria increased its military spending by 1.2 percent to $1.7 billion as it strives to defeat the radical Islamist group Boko Haram. Similarly, Kenya and Mali increased military spending due to extremist threats in their regions.\n\n            ",

Bush's administration.\nThe top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Dianne Feinstein, questioned Gorsuch about why he had written \"yes\" on a document next to a question about whether a CIA torture program had produced useful intelligence.\n\"My recollection of 12 years ago is that that was the position that the clients were telling us,\" Gorsuch said. \"I was a lawyer. My job was as an advocate, and we were dealing with detainee litigation. That was my job.\"\nAnother Democrat, Senator Patrick Leahy, asked Gorsuch if he agreed with the Bush administration's premise that the president has the authority to revoke torture and surveillance laws. Leahy said the Bush administration argued that \"the law\" gave presidents the constitutional authority to circumvent such measures.\nGorsuch replied that \"Presidents make all sorts of arguments about inherent authority - they do - and that is why we have the courts, to decide.\"\nOn his third day of questioning by the Senate panel, Gorsuch defended his philosophy of judicial originalism, which focuses on the Constitution's text, saying it is meant to provide equal protection for all.\nFrom left, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen.

Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., meet on Capitol Hill in Washington, March 22, 2017, prior to the start of the committee's confirmation hearing for Supreme Court Justice nominee Neil Gorsuch.\nWhen Senator Feinstein asked how the philosophy reconciles with the rights of gays and lesbians, Gorsuch noted there was precedence on the issue. \"It matters not a whit that some of the drafters of the 14th Amendment were racists, because they were, or sexists, because they were.\"\n\"The law they drafted promises equal protection of the law to add persons,\" he added.\nGorsuch tried to distance himself from reports that President Trump, White House advisor Steve Bannon and White House Chief of Staff Prince Priebus told donors they would nominate a Supreme Court justice who is \"pro-corporate and socially conservative.\"\nGorsuch responded that he speaks for himself, and not the president or anyone else.\nDemocrats have portrayed Gorsuch as a pro-corporate jurist who would tilt the legal playing field against ordinary Americans, and continued to press him on cases in which he sided with large companies over their employees.\nJudicial nominees, both liberal and conservative, historically have refused to allow themselves to be pinned down on pending legal issues during their confirmation hearings, and Gorsuch continued to do the same.\nRepublicans hold a slim two-seat Senate majority and would need eight Democrats to support Gorsuch should a filibuster necessitate a three-fifths vote to advance his nomination in the full chamber.\nDemocrats are under intense pressure from progressive activists to oppose Gorsuch, but Republicans have the option of changing Senate rules to eliminate the minority party\u2019s ability to block Supreme Court nominees should Democrats vote as a block against him.\n\n            ",

These countries have signed preliminary agreements for several infrastructure and power projects.\nFILE - Map illustrating China's \"One Belt, One Road\" megaproject at the Asian Financial Forum in Hong Kong, Jan. 18, 2016.\nCalling the initiative, \u201ca new kind of colonization,\u201d Chintamani Mahapatra, a professor at the School of international studies at New Delhi\u2019s Jawaharlal Nehru University, said \u201cthe OBOR [One belt, One road] project is very clearly Chinese-initiated, promoted by China with a strategic goal simply because China has a lot of money. When multiple countries are involved in a huge project like this, it should not be proposed, funded by only one country.\u201d\nForeign Ministry spokesman Bagley also underlined the need for transparency, saying that it could drive communities into debt.\nChina, however, points out that over 100 countries around the world and international organizations have got involved in the initiative, which it says has gotten a \u201cwarm response\u201d from the international community.\nChinese President Xi Jinping (center) stands with Russian President Vladimir Putin (left) Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (right) and other leaders to pose for a group photo before the opening ceremony of the Belt and Road Forum.\nIndeed some analysts caution India on missing out on an ambitious initiative that aims to integrate Asia with Europe through a network of rail lines and ports and create new trade corridors.\nT.N.

That is a problem unless China does something to mitigate our concerns there,\u201d said Ranade.\n\n            ",

The U.N. refugee agency expects that number to exceed 1.5 million this year as refugees continue to flee political instability and abuse in Burundi.\nPeace talks between the government and opposition are stalled.

A Wife Seeks Her Husband Missing in China\nGANZHOU, CHINA \u2014\u00a0\nWhen the police called, Deng Guilian was at an indoor playground watching her 3-year-old. It was 2:19 p.m., Tuesday, May 30.\nThe man on the phone said her husband had been picked up on suspicion of making illegal recordings and taking illegal photographs. He told her she didn't need to know the details, he just needed her address so he could send a formal notification.\n\u201cCould you please say that again?\u201d Deng asked.\nHer husband, Hua Haifeng, was a thousand kilometers (620 miles) away from her, in Ganzhou, a city in southeastern China where he had been investigating working conditions at factories that until at least March made shoes for Ivanka Trump's brand. He and his colleagues at China Labor Watch, a New York nonprofit, were preparing to publish a report alleging low pay, excessive overtime, crude verbal abuse and possible misuse of student labor at Huajian Group factories. The company denies the allegations.\nA man rides a motorbike outside of a Huajian Group shoe factory in Ganzhou in southeastern China's Jiangxi Province, June 6, 2017.\nDeng grew furious at the man on the phone.\n\u201cI have to take care of old people and children. All the money comes from him,\u201d she spat. \u201cYou tell me what I should do.\u201d\nThere was a pause. \u201cI don't know,\u201d the voice answered.\nShe hung up without giving her address.\nDeng, 36, had entered the swelling ranks of relatives swept up in Beijing's crackdown on human rights lawyers and labor activists. Hundreds have been detained, leaving many of their extended families with no source of income.\nBeyond financial suffering, the Chinese government wields great power over the lives of its citizens, which it can use to make things better - or infinitely worse - for those left behind. Wives, husbands, children and grandparents are left to look on solemnly as their lives are systematically dismembered until all that remains are the bones of fear: How will I feed my children? Will we keep our house? When will we see each other again?\nDeng was terrified. Standing at the playground, watching children trying to catch goldfish, she felt like she might fall down. She didn't know whom to talk to. Her husband's ailing parents didn't know what kind of work Hua did. They just knew he made money for everybody.\nAbove all, she had to protect her children, from sadness and fear and whatever else lay ahead. She would tell them lies and buy them chocolate late at night when they cried for a father they weren't supposed to know was missing. It would be days before Deng herself could eat.\n\"Papa was taken away by a monster\"\nRewind. Back to when idealism didn't seem to cost so much.\nDeng met her husband in 2006 on an online chat group for people from Nanzhang county, where they are both from. A petite woman with a quick, wide smile, Deng liked Hua because he made her laugh. Deng began working in factories after high school, helping to churn out clothes, toys and electronics across Guangdong province, the heartland of China's manufacturing boom. She sat in on information sessions Hua organized to help workers learn their legal rights, and fell in love with both the man - even though she thought he was kind of short - and his ideas.\nShe wore a white Western gown when they married in 2010. It was a simple ceremony, at home, with no rings or fancy jewelry. She believed they were on the right side of things, working to make society better for everyone, not just the rich and the lucky.\nHua's latest investigation had taken him inside the Huajian Group, which has pumped out millions of pairs of shoes a year for brands including Ivanka Trump's from factories in China and Ethiopia. In May, Hua went undercover as a worker at one of their factories in Dongguan.\nWhen he tried to travel to Hong Kong, he was blocked and taken out for lunch by the police, who warned him to stop the investigation. China Labor Watch, which has been exposing labor abuses for 17 years, says authorities had never made such a move before.\nHua kept working, turning his attention to Huajian's factory in Ganzhou, along with his colleagues Li Zhao and Su Heng.\nRight up until Sunday afternoon, Deng and Hua chatted and exchanged photos by phone: Their 7-year-old daughter, Chen Chen, in a new dress, their son, Bo Bo, in mirrored sunglasses that made him look like a little bug.\nThen Hua went silent.\n\u201cYou disappeared?\u201d Deng texted Monday afternoon, hoping to convince herself it was nothing.\nIn this photo taken in 2016 and released by Deng Guilian, Deng Guilian, left, her husband Hua Haifeng, right, and their son Bo Bo pose for a photo during a visit to a park in Chengde in northern China's Hebei Province.\nThat night, Bo Bo inexplicably burst into tears. \u201cPapa was taken away by a monster,\u201d the boy said. He told his mother he wanted a weapon so he could transform himself into the superhero Ultraman and fight the monster.\n\u201cYou do not have a weapon to transform yourself,\u201d Deng told her child. \u201cAnd you are not Ultraman.\u201d\nBut the boy insisted he would find a magical weapon and save his dad with his great new power.\n\"Each one was like a wolf\"\nDeng got the call about her husband two days after he disappeared. She soon began to regret decisions made long ago, like leaving work to take care of the family. It was what her husband had wanted, but now seemed stupid, isolating. She had only 400 yuan ($59) in cash. She didn't dare use the family credit card because Hua paid that bill, and how would he pay from jail?\n\u201cI feel so embarrassed that I do not have money,\u201d Deng said. \u201cLook at me now. I am just a housewife.\u201d\nShe took loans from family members to pay the bills. The days were anxious. The nights worse. She went to bed with her phone clutched in her hand.\nHer husband's disappearance had thrust Deng roughly back into society. She scrambled to learn about lawyers and fielded so many calls from foreign journalists she didn't have time to brush her teeth.\n\u201cI was a blank sheet of paper before,\u201d she said. \u201cNow I have no choice, I have to get to know this circle. It is hard.\u201d\nShe said she never wanted to get involved with the police or the Chinese government or, most unimaginable of all, the president of the United States and his daughter.\nIvanka Trump has not commented on the arrests. Deng wishes she would, and believes she could help. \u201cAs a wife and mother of two children, I ask Ivanka Trump to release my husband,\u201d she said.\nDeng struggled to help her husband while caring for her children. Her 3-year-old grabbed peaches from the kitchen and fed himself, but he was still hungry. She sent him and his sister off to their aunt's house for two days, without explaining why. The children kept calling to say they missed her cooking and their toys.\nThree days after the first phone call, police began searching for Deng. They knocked on the doors of family members in town, who Deng had been trying to hide the terrible news from, humiliating her in front of her neighbors.\n\u201cPeople here may think as long as someone is being taken away, this person must be evil,\u201d she said. They eventually tracked her down at her mother's house and drove her to the station around 9 p.m. that Friday night.\nFour men took her into a small room and pulled their chairs in a tight circle around her.\n\u201cEach one was like a wolf,\u201d she said.\nOne man stared at her. Another wrote down everything she said. A third examined her phone, scrolling through her exchanges with foreign journalists. \u201cYou don't know these people but you told them how old your children are and where you live,\u201d a fourth man said. \u201cDo you think that's safe?\u201d\nIt was after midnight when they let her go.\n\u201c'Do not let your husband's crime turn into something like leaking state secrets,\u201d' Deng said she was told. \u201cThey spoke so seriously. Anyway, I don't understand, but it was just terrifying.\u201d\nThe following afternoon, the post office called to say they had a letter for her. She raced over on her bicycle and tore the envelope open with a knife at home. As expected, it was the official police notice of her husband's arrest.\nShe finally knew for sure what had happened to Hua.\nFor the first time in nearly a week, Deng was hungry. She sat down to a bowl of her mother's steaming rice porridge and fried green vegetables.\nThe police called again and came by to take her to the village committee office. The Communist Party secretary of the village, a local official and a policeman began asking about her family. They took photographs of her text message exchanges with The Associated Press. They told her Hua was in serious trouble and advised her to make smart decisions.\nThey offered to help her financially, and to provide good health care to her mother, who suffers from serious diabetes. They said her home would finally get the running water her family had long sought, which would mean Deng could stop hauling well water upstairs in buckets.\nThe more these men talked, the more she grieved, until she burst. The men watched as she cried - for her sick mother, her children, her isolation, her sudden poverty, her lost husband.\nShe went home calm and determined.\nWhat she had to do was simple: Her husband needed clothing and food. She would deliver them.\n\u201cI will not be afraid,\u201d she said, using a Chinese expression, \u201cI dare to climb a mountain of swords or plunge into a sea of flames.\u201d\nDeng Guilian holds the hand of her son Bo Bo, 3, as they walk through a train station in Ganzhou in southern China's Jiangxi Province, June 7, 2017.\nBuying underwear for other people's husbands\nDeng packed a single black backpack and the next morning boarded a standing-room-only train with her son and sister-in-law for the 12-hour journey to Ganzhou, where her husband and his two colleagues were being held on allegations of using secret recording devices to disrupt Huajian's business. It was folly making a 3-year-old stand up through the night, but she figured they could camp out in the canteen car and pick on fried cucumber with pork while the child slept. His sister stayed with Hua's parents.\nEight days after Hua's disappearance, Deng arrived in Ganzhou, a relatively poor Chinese city better known for oranges than factories that sits astride a lazy brown river in southeastern China's Jiangxi province. One of its biggest corporate players is Huajian, the company that Hua, Li and Su had been investigating.\nThe shoe factory where the alleged labor violations occurred sits in a growing complex of Huajian buildings, all painted the same pale blue, including rows of Huajian apartment towers, a Huajian innovation park, a Huajian school and a Huajian swimming pool.\nThe first thing Deng did when she arrived was install her son and sister-in-law in a small hotel room with cheery yellow walls. Then she hired a lawyer. Then she went shopping.\nShe figured Hua's colleagues could also use a few things, but she agonized over what sizes to buy for the men. Li Zhao was so big she worried even XL wouldn't fit. Su Heng she'd never set eyes on. Medium seemed like a safe bet.\n\u201cI've never bought underwear for other people's husbands,\u201d Deng said, laughing.\nTwo hours later, she stumbled out in her high wedge sandals, tripping under the weight of three pairs of slippers, six pairs of shorts, six T-shirts, three towels and nine pairs of underwear. It cost 450 yuan ($66), nearly half of her rainy day fund.\nShe brought everything back to the detention center. She didn't know the center's rules and came at the wrong time, and she didn't know she had to label everything. Worse, they forbade rope and made her pull the string out of the waistband of all the men's shorts. She worried they would all fall down. She put money on meal cards for the three men.\nSummer rains washed across Ganzhou, leaving the air hot and heavy. There was no air conditioning at the detention center. When the lawyer Deng had hired, Wen Yu, came out, his hair was wet with sweat. He'd been waiting since 9 a.m. to meet Hua and sometime after 5 p.m. was finally permitted to see him for one minute, just long enough to introduce himself. Deng was not allowed to visit her husband and was anxious for news.\n\u201cWe need to try again tomorrow,\u201d Wen said.\nPolice from her hometown, Deng learned, had visited Hua in jail, urging him to write a letter telling his wife to stop talking with the foreign media. Police also threatened her brother-in-law, she said.\nWen was ordered not to speak with foreign reporters and he stopped granting interviews. On Tuesday, police visited the hotel in Ganzhou where Deng was speaking with AP journalists, sending a maid up to knock on the door, effectively cutting short the interview.\nPolice in Ganzhou and Jiangxi, as well as in Deng's hometown could not be reached immediately for comment.\nChinese state-run media began publishing photos of the evidence collected against her husband and his colleagues, claiming they had all confessed.\nBut Deng still talked. The more they tried to stop her, the more she wanted to speak.\nShe talked so much her mouth dried out and her voice grew raspy.\nWhat, she wondered, was so threatening about her story?\n\u201cI have an unknown tenacity,\u201d she said.\nLawyer hired, underwear delivered, by Wednesday it was time to go home.\n\u201cI want to stay here,\u201d Bo Bo said. \u201cI don't want to go home.\u201d\n\u201cHere, I bought you snacks, chips and chicken,\u201d Deng said. \u201cCome on, put your shoes on.\u201d\nA 10-minute taxi ride later, Deng hoisted Bo Bo to her hip and stepped through a metal gate with her sister-in-law into the cool blue of the train station. She wiped her son's nose, gave him water and played with him on the grimy floor while they waited.\nDeng hoped to rest when she got home, but expected the police would be there again for her in the morning and maybe the afternoon too, reminding her they were there, watching. She was not afraid. China is a country of laws, she believed, and as long as she didn't break them, nothing bad would happen.\nThen again, there was her husband, who she believed had done nothing wrong and was at that very moment in jail, eating bad food and sleeping by a plastic bucket used as a toilet by 20 men who had been ordered not to speak to him. At least he hadn't been beaten.\nAt 1:12 p.m., the green train to Xiangyang city eased forward, carrying Deng and her son off to an uncertain future.\n\n            ",

He said he grew up in a home with thousands of books and has spent his life dedicated to the care, preservation and dissemination of books.\nHe acknowledged he hasn't read all of the presidential collection, but said he hopes they will be useful to students.\nThe collection shows how perceptions of presidents have changed over time. For example, the earliest book about Washington was written in 1931; the latest in 2009. The most recent addition is a 1,400-word book about Obama that covers his life until just before he became president.\n\"Washington is a good example \u2014 the first president continues to be cited as a model of decorum and honesty and all of those good virtues going back a couple hundred years,'' Young said. \"You learn how the presidency and its meaning changes over time.''\nNeil Levesque, director of the institute, said the donation reinforces the facility's value to scholars, journalists and the public and will provide rich research opportunities for students.\n\"The students here are going to use this for many, many years to come,'' he said.\nUntil now, the library has mainly been devoted to campaign memorabilia and other items related to New Hampshire's tradition of holding the first-in-the-nation presidential primary every four years.\nThe small room that is now lined with glass-front bookcases filled with Young's donated books had been used as a meeting space and reading room but had few actual books.

Kelner said when the White House asked Flynn afterwards to complete the process, \"he did so.\"\nFlynn's amended forms were released late Friday along with scores of other financial statements from senior White House staff.\nNews about Flynn's failure to report all his financial dealings with Russia came as the Federal Bureau of Investigation as well as the Senate and House of Representatives intelligence committees are investigating Russia's interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and how much interaction White House senior staff members had with Russia.\nTrump had named Flynn as his national security adviser before the president was sworn into office. Flynn served, however, as head of the National Security Council for just 24 days before he was forced to step down - not specifically because of his Russian ties, according to Trump administration officials, but because he misled Vice President Mike Pence by failing to declare his meetings with Russia's ambassador to the U.S.\nFlynn had met with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the post-election transition period without advising the administration of former President Barack Obama, who was still in office at the time. The retired general also gave Pence and other White House officials a false version of his contacts with the Russian envoy.\n\n            ",

But as more nations are working to manage their resources to prevent overfishing in their offshore and coastal waters, IUUF is a growing concern, according to the U.N.\nAlthough hard numbers are difficult to gather, the world's fisheries in 2012 produced roughly 160 million tons of fish and generated over $129 billion in exports while providing nutrition for billions of people, according to World Bank data.\nFILE - Indonesia Minister of Marine Affairs Susi Pudjiastuti speaks in Washington, Sept. 16, 2016. Pudjiastuti has been pushing to make illegal fishing a transnational crime since 2015.\nSpeaking at the U.N. Ocean Conference this week in New York City, Pudjiastuti said fishing boat crews involved in IUUF \"are involved not only in fish crimes but also smuggling drugs, weapons and other illegal economic products, even human trafficking. This disrupts domestic economic competition because the perpetrators have no cost and gain so much profit.\"\nThere is little disagreement that billions of dollars, or even tens of billions, are at stake with IUUF each year.\nDependent on ocean, fishing\nAccording to the World Bank, Indonesia, which has 2.6 million fishermen and 140 million citizens who rely on marine and coastal economic systems, claims IUUF losses up to tens of millions of dollars per year.\nPudjiastuti has been pushing to make illegal fishing a transnational crime since 2015.\nShe has the backing of General Assembly President Peter Thomson, a diplomat from Fiji, a Pacific Island nation that \"is extremely reliant on marine resources from an economic and food security perspective,\" according to a study by the David and Lucile Packard Foundation.\n\"I welcome Indonesia's efforts in this field. IUUF is indeed a transnational crime,\" Thomson told VOA Indonesia. \"Ultimately, it is the responsibility of all parties, international organizations, governments, civil society, NGOs and the scientific community. This is not just an individual's responsibility but the responsibility of all of us.\"\nWith others at the conference, Thomson also spoke out against the plague of plastic waste polluting the world's oceans.\nWATCH: UN Official Peter Thomson: 'The Ocean Is in Deep Trouble'\nVideo size\nwidth\nx\nheight\npixels\nUN Official Peter Thomson: 'The Ocean Is in Deep Trouble'\nShare this video\n0:01:48\n\u25b6\n0:00:00\n/0:01:48\n\u25b6\n\u25b6\nDirect link\n270p | 5.3MB\n360p | 7.8MB\n720p | 52.0MB\n\"The sea is in the midst of a plastic-and-pollution disaster,\" he said. \"If we don't act, there will be more plastic than fish in 2050.\"\nIndonesians, who produce more ocean waste than any nation other than China, rallied to this issue at the conference. Among the Indonesian delegates were Melati and Isabel Wijsen, two Bali teenagers who initiated Bye Bye Plastic Bags, the community movement that aims to reduce plastic waste.\nSustainable goals\nCombating IUUF is one of the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals, which include steps to end overfishing; end illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and destructive fishing practices; and implement science-based management plans. The U.N. hopes the steps restore fish stocks in the shortest time feasible, at least to levels that can produce maximum sustainable yield as determined by their biological characteristics.\nThe Sustainable Development Goals were adopted by all 193 heads of state via a U.N. resolution in September 2015 at a special Summit of the United Nations in New York.\nPudjiastuti is both revered and criticized for her hard-line approach to combat illegal fishing. Last year, Indonesia, made up of more than 17,000 islands, sank 60 foreign fishing ships as part of its independence day celebrations.\nIn May, Pudjiastuti was one of the recipients of the Peter Benchley Ocean Award \u2014 named after the author of Jaws. She was cited for her efforts in protecting Indonesia's marine ecosystem, as well as tackling poachers and organized crime.\nFILE - A plastic bottle lies among other debris washed ashore on an Indian Ocean beach in Uswetakeiyawa, north of Colombo, Sri Lanka, Aug. 13, 2015.\nAbout 10,000 vessels a year use to fish in Indonesian waters, but that has stopped. \"We catch them and we sink them, and it has been an effective deterrence,\" she said.\nSince taking office in 2014, after a three-decade career as a seafood entrepreneur, Pudjiastuti has blown up hundreds of vessels, but the tactic has created tensions with regional neighbors.\nChina causes concerns\nIndonesian officials are particularly worried about China's expansion of its fishing fleets and occasional forays into the waters of other countries in the region.\nIn the past, Pudjiastuti has said they have captured few Chinese vessels, which are big, fast and often accompanied by their nation's coast guard.\nBut she continues to push for an end to IUUF.\n\"It's better to have an idea that is too early than too late,\" she said. \"I am proud that Indonesia is thinking about this ahead of other countries, and that we have actually done it, not just talk about it.\"\nThis report originated with VOA Indonesia.\n\n            ",

High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi talks to an Afghan refugee woman during his visit to the UNHCR's Repatriation Center in Peshawar, Pakistan, June 23, 2016.\nHRW senior researcher Patricia Gossman, while sharing details of the report at a news conference in Kabul, said the exodus amounts to the world\u2019s largest unlawful mass forced return of refugees in recent times.\n\u201cThe way Pakistan carried that out was through a range [of] abuses toward the refugee[s] and the undocumented Afghans in Pakistan. And this included, detentions, extortion, extracting bribes, the closure of Afghan schools, raids on people's homes and other threats, including from the local population that Afghans we[re] no longer welcome.\u201d\nPakistan denies coercion \nPakistani authorities maintain that areas where Afghan refugees reside have lately become security challenges and safe havens for anti-state militants, and after hosting them for four decades, host communities also want the refugees to be relocated. But Islamabad denies allegations of any concerted campaign of abuse and coercion.\nGossman warned that the refugee families pushed out of Pakistan are returning to expanding armed conflict in Afghanistan where they also face widespread destitution and a near-total absence of social services.\nThe report harshly criticized the U.N. Refugee Agency, or UNHCR, for allegedly facilitating repatriation of refugees from Pakistan, saying the agency was actually complicit in this forced return of displaced families.\n\u201cRather than saying something, speak out publicly when this concerted campaign by Pakistan began, UNHCR in Pakistan remained silent and in fact increased its cash grant to the refugees all of which facilitated the return of hundreds of thousands of people in conditions that cannot be called voluntary.\"\nFILE - Afghan refugee women, clad in a burqa, climb on a truck to be repatriated to Afghanistan, at the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) office on the outskirts of Peshawar, Feb. 13, 2015.\nUNHCR promptly responded to the allegations, saying it disagrees with the conclusions of the HRW report. In a statement sent to VOA, the agency said that throughout 2016, it has informed Afghans of their rights, intervened in cases of unlawful arrest and detention, and intervened in nearly 6,000 cases of arrest, securing the release of almost all.\n\u201cUNHCR does not promote returns to Afghanistan given the enduring conflict in different parts of the country and its limited absorption capacity. At the same time, the agency does help those who decide to return based on the options available to them,\u201d the agency said in the statement.\nComplex situation\nIt maintained that the multiple drivers behind the surge in the returnees are complex and influenced by shifting regional dynamics and relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan.\nFILE - Afghan refugees living in Pakistan wait to get their documents to travel back to Afghanistan, at the UNHCR's Repatriation Center, in Peshawar, Pakistan, Sept. 7, 2016.\n\u201cThey include pressures by authorities amidst broader security operations, changing attitudes among host communities, uncertainty about the renewal of refugee ID cards, economic hardship, stricter border controls disrupting trade and family ties. There was also a campaign by the Afghan government in Pakistan to encourage Afghans to return home.\u201d\nSpeaking in Kabul, Gossman also slammed Afghan authorities for encouraging the refugees to return when the conflict has worsened and the government is unable to deliver on its resettlement incentives.\n\u201cIt is very reckless and irresponsible at the very least to promise land or other advantages to people who return when that is actually not forthcoming.\u201d\n\n            ",

Flynn had been kept on the job for 18 days after the acting attorney general, Sally Yates, had warned the White House that he could be subject to blackmail from the Russians because he had misled Pence.\nThen, a day after Trump ousted Flynn, associates of former FBI chief James Comey, whom Trump fired last week, say that the president urged Comey at a White House meeting to drop his investigation of Flynn and that Comey soon after made extensive notes about his conversation with Trump.\nThe White House says Comey's contemporaneous recollection of his discussions with Trump are not accurate, while some legal experts say that if true,Trump's efforts to end the Flynn probe could be construed as obstruction of justice, an impeachable offense.\nFILE - Vice President Mike Pence, left, and Secret Service Director Joseph Clancy stand as President Donald Trump shakes hands with FBI Director James Comey during a reception for inaugural law enforcement officers and first responders in the Blue Room of the White House.\nLast week, Trump said that as he was thinking of \"this Russia thing,\" he fired Comey, who was leading the FBI's investigation of the Trump campaign's links to Russia. Trump has been dismissive of investigations of his campaign's links to Russia, saying that claims of Moscow's meddling in the election to help him win are an excuse by Democrats to explain his upset win over former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\nThe Comey firing and the reports of Trump's attempt to curb the Flynn investigation led to calls from lawmakers, Democrats and some Republicans, for appointment a special prosecutor in the Russia investigation. Mueller will fill a role independent of the normal channels of authority at the country's Department of Justice.\nTrump team notified about probe \nThe New York Times said in a Thursday report that the new Trump administration named Flynn as national security adviser even though Flynn told the president-elect's transition team weeks before the January 20 inauguration that he was under federal investigation for secretly working during the presidential campaign as a paid lobbyist for Turkish interests in the United States. Flynn was paid more than $500,000.\nThe inspector general at the U.S. Defense Department announced recently it is investigating whether Flynn sought permission for the Russian and Turkish payments after he was specifically warned when he retired from the military to not accept any money from foreign governments.\nMeanwhile, Reuters reported that Flynn and other Trump aides were in contact with Russian officials and others with Kremlin ties in at least 18 calls and emails in the last seven months of the presidential campaign ahead of the November 8 vote.\nOusted by Obama administration \nFlynn headed the Defense Intelligence Agency for two years under former President Barack Obama, until he was ousted in 2014 for his chaotic management of the spy agency.\nLater, Flynn emerged as a sharp critic of Obama's handling of national security matters, while supporting Trump's long-shot run for the presidency.\nFlynn made a speech at last year's Republican national convention that handed Trump the party's presidential nomination. Flynn led thousands of party faithful in an anti-Clinton chant, \"Lock her up!\" for the way she handled national security material on her private email server while she was the country's top diplomat from 2009 to 2013.\n\n            ",

We don't benefit from not talking about it,\" the president said. \"The fact that these things are surfacing means we can solve them.\"\nProsecutors in Cook County, Illinois, announced hate crime and aggravated kidnapping charges Thursday afternoon against Jordan Hill, Brittany Covington and Tesfaye Cooper, all 18, and Tanishia Covington, 24.\nVideo of the incident shows four black attackers repeatedly stabbing and punching an unidentified white man who had been tied up and had duct tape placed over his mouth.\nThe video also shows the attackers forcing the mentally disabled man to drink water out of a toilet and roughly cutting some hair off his scalp before putting ash from a cigar on the bleeding wound.\nThroughout the video, the attackers can be heard yelling profane comments about white people and President-elect Donald Trump.

His crimes cost the firm at least $2 million above what insurance covered, led to layoffs of about a dozen employees and is expected to cause some $20 million in financial fallout because of the blow to the firm's reputation, according to founder Bernard Gudvi.\nThe embezzlement was discovered by a new money manager Morissette hired.\n\"It was at this time, I realized he also stole my dreams,\" she said.\nWhen the firm was contacted about the apparent theft, Schwartz made \"wild accusations\" that his former client was in the throes of drug addiction and mentally unstable, Gudvi said. Schwartz also falsely claimed he invested the money in an illegal marijuana growing business.\n\"As the walls were closing in on the scheme to steal client funds ... he was unable to turn away from the lies,\" Gudvi wrote in a letter to the court. \"The worse things became, the more easily he seemed to dispense with the truth.\"\nSchwartz has blamed the crimes on a gambling addiction but prosecutors said he took the money to finance a lavish lifestyle and never showed sincere regret.\n\"Every expression of remorse he has made and every purported act of self-improvement he has taken occurred only after he realized he had no 'choice' to do otherwise,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Ranee Katzenstein said in court papers.\nSchwartz, who was fired, had offered financial guidance to some of the biggest stars and was said to represent Beyonce and Mariah Carey, who both appeared at a fundraiser last year in support of a heart disease charity he founded.\nSchwartz penned a mea culpa in The Hollywood Reporter last month. He said his father was a gambling addict who abandoned his family and he sought refuge in sports betting and drugs to deal with the stress from his business.\n\"The spiral I was in was toxic,\" Schwartz wrote. \"Winning did not make me feel better but losing was intolerable. If I lost, then I had to make it back and when I lost again, the hole I had dug got deeper and deeper. I felt weak and powerless, terrified by my internal demons that I was turning into my father.\"\n\n            ",

It soured when Australia supported East Timorese independence from Indonesia in 2002. \nMore recently in 2015, diplomatic tension rose when Jakarta executed two members of an Australian drug trafficking gang despite pleas for mercy from Canberra. In January, Indonesia briefly suspended bilateral military ties after a dispute at an Australian Special Forces base in Perth. \nOptimism for trade progress\nThose anxieties have soothed, and there is optimism that Widodo\u2019s visit will see meaningful progress on a free trade agreement.\nAaron Connelly, an analyst at the Lowy Institute, a Sydney-based think tank, says ties between the two countries are in good shape.\n\u201cThe remarkable thing here is that despite that background of irritation that we see on occasion, relations between the two are actually pretty good,\u201d Connelly said. \u201cMinisters on both sides have good relationships with their counterparts, and you also have Australian feelings towards Indonesia at a high.\n\u201cIn our Lowy Institute poll last year we asked Australians to rank countries on a thermometer from zero to 100, and Indonesia ranked at 56 degrees, which is the highest result we have ever seen in 11 years of polling,\u201d he added.\nSouth China Sea also on agenda\nWidodo and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull are also expected to discuss the dangers posed by radicalized fighters returning home from the conflict in Iraq and Syria. Tensions over the South China Sea are an additional topic on the agenda, along with the possibility of joint navy patrols in the area.\nWhile significant, the Indonesian leader\u2019s visit to Sydney will be brief.

The bridge, renamed Saturday as Martyrs Bridge, was the scene of clashes between civilians and military tanks.\nPeople gather for a ceremony marking the first anniversary of an attempted coup at the Bosporus Bridge in Istanbul, Turkey, July 15, 2017.\nIn a speech later in the day, Erdogan said the perpetrators of the coup should be killed or imprisoned in a facility like the United States' Guantanamo Bay prison. He said if Turkey's parliament passed a law authorizing the death penalty for those instigators, he would sign it.\n\"They showed no mercy when they pointed their guns at my people,\" Erdogan said, referring to the coup leaders. \"What did my people have? They had their flags \u2014 just as they do today \u2014 and something much more important: They had their faith.\"\nThousands march\nSaturday's marchers waved hundreds of red Turkish flags emblazoned with the star and crescent. Thousands marched through the streets of Istanbul in an act of unity, converging at the bridge where Turkish citizens clashed with tanks and members of the military who were trying to assume control. Some of the marchers carried photographs of those who died in the fighting, which included a bomb attack on parliament.\nPeople listen to the speech of Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan during a ceremony marking the first anniversary of a coup attempt at the Bosporus Bridge in Istanbul, July 15, 2017.\nOpposition leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu made a statement Saturday, too. His recalled the changes in Turkey since the coup attempt that culminated in a referendum in April that awarded Erdogan sweeping executive powers.\n\"This parliament, which withstood bombs, has been rendered obsolete and its authority removed,\" Kilicdaroglu said. \"In the past year, justice has been destroyed. Instead of rapid normalization, a permanent state of emergency has been implemented.\"\nThe Turkish government also marked the anniversary by firing nearly 7,400 additional civil servants.\nDivisions widen\nErdogan had previously dismissed at least 100,000 civil servants he characterized as supporters of the aborted coup and arrested another 50,000 people. The scale of the purge has widened political divisions in Turkey, with government opponents denouncing it as an attempt to silence Erdogan's detractors.\nAt a special parliamentary session Saturday, Prime Minister Binali Yildirim described the aborted coup as \"Turkey's darkest and longest night,\" which was \"transformed into a bright day.\"\nGiant posters designed by the Erdogan administration have been placed on billboards in Istanbul displaying images portraying significant events such as the surrender of opposition troops.\nThe U.S. State Department issued a statement Friday applauding Turkish people \"of all backgrounds and political views\" who \"took to the streets to preserve the rights and freedoms of their democratic society.\"\n\"Their actions continue to remind us that the preservation of democracy requires perseverance, tolerance, dissent and safeguards for fundamental freedoms,\" the statement added.\nSavas Altay weeps as he visits an outdoor exhibition featuring photographs of July 15, 2016, coup attempt, in Istanbul, July 14, 2017.

Gulen denies any involvement.\nIn a statement released Saturday, Gulen said the Turkish government's \"treatment of innocent citizens during the past year is dragging Turkey into the category of the countries with the worst record of democracy, the rule of law and fundamental freedoms in the world.\" Gulen's statement also said the Turkish people \"are being rallied en masse around hate messages.\"\nAbout 250 people were killed and more than 2,000 others injured last year when a disgruntled army faction commandeered tanks and warplanes in a bid to overthrow Erdogan after 1\u00bd decades in power. Thirty-five coup organizers were also killed.\n\n            ",

But so far Beijing is keeping more extreme retaliation measures in reserve. \nIn late December and again last week, a formation including the Liaoning aircraft carrier plied waters around Taiwan, which is 160 kilometers southeast of China. Last month, the African nation Sao Tome and Principe severed two decades of formal relations with Taiwan to recognize China. Last week Nigeria cut informal ties with Taiwan, saying it\u2019s not a country.\nWarnings from China \nThose moves are meant to warn Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen against growing closer with the United States since her surprise phone call Dec. 2 to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and in light of her trip to the Americas Jan. 7-14, experts say. The United States sells Taiwan arms and has a law allowing it to help Taiwan defend itself. \nBut China has spared the more salient threats of the past in case Tsai cools toward the United States and seeks talks with Beijing, experts say. \n\u201cInternational space was given to Taiwan, quote unquote, and as someone born and brought up in Taiwan we hate to acknowledge that, but space was given to Taiwan on the basis of understanding that there is no tension across Taiwan Straits,\u201d said Joanna Lei, chief executive officer of the Chunghua 21st Century think tank in Taiwan.\n\u201cOnce that tension is increased, then it\u2019s no denial that Taiwan\u2019s international space will be reduced, and that will be something Tsai Ing-wen\u2019s government has to grapple with and has to have a reaction to,\u201d she said. \nChina sees Taiwan as part of China \nChina sees Taiwan as part of its territory, despite the island\u2019s self-rule since the 1940s, and insists the two sides eventually unify. It worries that Taiwan\u2019s autonomy will get a boost if Taiwanese leaders deepen relations overseas, especially with the United States. \nIn 1995 and 1996, China fired missiles into the Taiwan Strait in what was seen then as an attempt to discourage Taiwanese from electing an anti-Beijing president. As late as 2005, senior Chinese officials threatened to use force against Taiwan if needed. \nFILE - Taiwan's \"frogmen\" Marines perform covert landing drills just a few kilometers from mainland China on the outlying island of Kinmen, Taiwan.\nPeople of Taiwan react \nBut those measures fanned anti-China sentiment in Taiwan, helping to install presidents who vowed to stand up to Beijing. Tsai, in office since May, has frustrated China for her unwillingness to hold talks on grounds that both sides belong to one country. But she has kept her tone toward Beijing polite, avoiding words or actions to upset it. \nBeijing is expected to avoid more drastic measures, such as buying off a series of Taiwan\u2019s remaining 21 diplomatic allies or testing missiles, but continue with milder threats. \nChina waiting on Trump \n\u201cChina must fear President-elect Trump because of Trump's unpredictability,\u201d said Coen Blaauw, executive director of the Washington-based, pro-Taiwan advocacy group Formosan Association for Public Affairs. \u201cThey must feel they need to do something in response to recent signals from the Trump camp in support of Taiwan, but stopping short of conducting missile tests. \n\u201cSo sailing the Liaoning aircraft carrier through the Taiwan Strait was probably the strongest signal they could think of given the circumstances,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is hard to imagine China going beyond that.\u201d \nThe cut in ties with Sao Tome and Principe still leaves Taiwan enough foreign allies to give it a voice in the United Nations, where China blocks Taiwan itself from participation. Nigeria did not have a diplomatic relationship and does not rank among Taiwan\u2019s top trading partners. \nTsai\u2019s travels this month took her to four Central American countries where she tightened relations. \nThe aircraft carrier, which passed through the Taiwan Strait Wednesday en route to northern China, entered Taiwan\u2019s air defense identification zone, but avoided its territorial seas. \nEconomic pressure \nThe number of group tourists from China to Taiwan declined 27 percent from May, when Tsai took office, over the following five months. The trend, which first began around the time of Tsai\u2019s January 2016 election, is seen as pressure by Beijing to pinch the island\u2019s economy without a more severe hit, such as cancelling trade or investment deals. \nBeijing may be watching now what follows Tsai\u2019s meeting Jan. 8 with Republican Senator Ted Cruz. The encounter may have built a bridge with the party that won control of the U.S. Congress in November. Tsai\u2019s 12-minute phone call to Trump in early December outraged China, which had grown used to U.S. leaders shunning contact with Taipei since the 1970s. \nWashington broke formal ties with Taiwan in 1979 in favor of the larger and faster-growing China. \nA stronger link with Trump following Tsai\u2019s call December 2 could bring Taiwan more military exchanges and more access to advanced weapons for defense against China. Taiwanese leaders also want a free trade deal that would help local exporters. \nThe warnings are seen as soft so far \u2013 they have incited little sustained outrage or fear in Taiwan \u2013 but could escalate if Taiwan's president does anything new that offends China. \n\u201cShe\u2019s not taking any chance, so that\u2019s why she\u2019s holding herself back. It\u2019s her view that it\u2019s better not to really irritate China more,\u201d said Shane Lee, political scientist at Chang Jung Christian University in Taiwan. \nBut some people in her Democratic Progressive Party, which includes a hard-line anti-China faction, hope for less holding back. Others in Taiwan want stronger China ties to boost trade and investment. \u201cShe is facing a lot of pressure from both within the party and from the society in general,\u201d Lee said. \n\n            ",

By mid-2016, the pipeline was all-but-completed, save for a segment planned to run under Lake Oahe, a reservoir formed by a dam on the Missouri River in land seized from the Standing Rock Sioux tribe.\nDuring the final weeks of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, the Army Corps of Engineers delayed a decision that would have allowed ETP to begin underwater drilling, and called for additional environmental impact studies. \nBut in January, President Donald Trump issued a directive calling on the Department of the Army and the Army Corps to take all \u201cnecessary and appropriate steps\u201d necessary to permit construction and operation of the pipeline, citing the \u201cnational interest.\u201d He noted that the DAPL and XL Keystone pipeline together would create thousands of new jobs for Americans.\nEllis maintains that Trump and the Army Corps of Engineers have acted in violation of the law and an 1868 treaty with the Sioux.\nPolice detain a man in an attempt to clear the Oceti Sakowin camp in Cannon Ball, North Dakota, U.S., February 23, 2017.\nIn January, the Administration said it would work closely with all parties involved as the pipeline project developed. In his regular press briefing Thursday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said, \u201cour team has been in contact with all the parties involved.\u201d\nHowever, Standing Rock Tribal Chairman David Archambault II released a statement shortly afterwards, saying, \u201cThat claim is absolutely false\u2026We repeatedly asked for meetings with the Trump Administration, but never received one until the day they notified Congress that they were issuing the easement.\u201d\nrenderExternalContent(\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nVTiW5MJ-jQ?&&fs=1\")\nPipeline safety\nThe oil industry has long contended that transporting oil through pipelines is far safer than by truck or train. But studies have shown this may not be the case:\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency requires all oil spills and other industrial accidents to be reported to the U.S. Coast Guard\u2019s National Response Center, information which the Center makes available on its public website.\nThe environmental non-profit Louisiana Bucket Brigade (LBB) recently examined the accident history of ETP and its Sunoco subsidiary. Their findings show that ETP/Sunoco was cited in 69 accidents during 2015 and 2016. The majority of them \u2013 51 percent \u2013 involved pipelines. The spills ranged in type and magnitude; in all, more than 111,000 gallons of pollution ended up being released into the environment and tens of thousands of gallons flowed into ponds, streams and rivers.\n\u201cWhat our report focused on is the fact that Energy Transfer Partners, whether in pipelines, refineries on shore or other infrastructures, has a history of polluting drinking water sources,\u201d said Anne Rolfes, LBB\u2019s founding director. \u201cAnd our feeling in looking at this information is that the Standing Rock Sioux are absolutely right in being concerned about their drinking watyer because this company has a past.\u201d\nETP did not respond to VOA\u2019s request for comment.\nLooking forward\nThe protests may have ended, but the fight against the pipeline will continue, say organizers. \nOn February 14, the tribe filed a motion in federal court, asking a judge to set aside Trump\u2019s pipeline reversal to be set aside.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve asked for an expedited schedule so we can get a ruling on this case before oil starts flowing through the pipeline,\u201d said Ellis. \u201cThe judge initially gave a 3 week schedule to rule on this motion. He has yet to set a court date, but we expect it could happen by the first week of March.\u201d\nIn the meantime, organizers and supporters plan a march on the White House March 10th, said Ellis, \u201cto peacefully - but powerfully - show solidarity with indigenous people around the world.\u201d\n\n            ",

In the highlands along the department of La Libertad, dramatic video showed crashing water inundating several buses and trucks, killing at least five people.\nRescuers were searching Friday for survivors.\nEven Peru's capital city of Lima, where a desert climate seldom leads to rain, police had to help hundreds of residents in an outskirt neighborhood cross a flooded road by sending them one-by-one along a rope. The muddy water channeled down the street after a major river overflowed. Some residents left their homes with just a single plastic bag carrying their belongings.\nIn total, more than 65,000 people in nearby Huachipa were unable to either go to work or return to their properties.\n\"There's no way to cross,'' said Henry Obando, who was rescued after leaving the factory where he works and making his way toward a rooftop where officers created a zip-line to cross. \"Many people are trying to get to their homes.''\nA woman is pulled to safety in a zipline harness in Lima, Peru, March 17, 2017.\nThe storms are being caused by a warms of the surface waters in the Pacific Ocean and are expected to continue for another two weeks. Kuczynski declared Peru's Central Highway in a state of emergency Friday and announced he would be boosting funds for reconstruction. He said he was optimistic the country was in a strong position to make a swift recovery but urged resident to use caution.\n\"This hasn't ended,'' he warned. \"And it will continue for some time more.''\nIn 1998, another El Nino event brought heavy rainfall to the nation's coast, causing landslides, ripping apart homes and leaving hundreds dead.\n\n            ",

Events include the swearing-in ceremony on the steps of the U.S. Capitol and a parade to the White House along streets thronged with spectators.\nOn Thursday, police cars lined much of Pennsylvania Avenue, the parade route, as workers unloaded crowd control fences from flatbed trucks, erected barricades and marked off pavement with tape.\nA protester yells as others gather for a march on the Capitol Building, Jan. 18, 2017, in Washington.\nNumbers of protests, rallies are up\nThe number of planned protests and rallies this year is far above what has been typical at recent presidential inaugurations.\nU.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said police aimed to keep groups separate, using similar tactics as employed during last year's political conventions.\n\u201cThe concern is some of these groups are pro-Trump, some of them are con-Trump, and they may not play well together in the same space,\u201d Johnson said on MSNBC.\nAbout 30 groups totaling 270,000 people have received permits to stage demonstrations, both for and against the New York businessman in Washington around the inauguration. That number includes some 200,000 people who police say they expect to attend Saturday's Women's March on Washington, an anti-Trump protest.\nDemonstrators hold banners as they protest in opposition of President-elect Donald Trump, at McPherson Square, in Washington, Jan. 14, 2017.\nBikers support Trump\nTrump opponents have been angered by his comments during the campaign about women, illegal immigrants and Muslims and his pledges to scrap the Obamacare health reform and build a wall on the Mexican border.\nThe Republican's supporters admire his experience in business, including as a real estate developer and reality television star, and view him as an outsider who will take a fresh approach to politics.\nBikers for Trump, a group that designated itself as security backup during last summer's Republican National Convention in Cleveland, is ready to step in if protesters block access to the inauguration, said Dennis Egbert, one of the group's organizers.\n\u201cWe're going to be backing up law enforcement.

It will take some time before we realize what we have truly lost.\"\nFormer U.S. President George H.W. Bush, who backed Kohl's effort to push through a speedy reunification when the opportunity presented itself, said Friday that Kohl was \"a true friend of freedom, and the man I consider one of the greatest leaders in postwar Europe.\"\nFormer U.S. President Bill Clinton, who served during Kohl's final years in office, called the tall, burly, lifelong politician \"the most important European statesman since the second World War.\"\nPolitical life\nKohl served 16 years as German chancellor, presiding over West Germany from 1982 to 1990 and serving as the first chancellor of the reunified Germany from 1990 to 1998.\nFILE - Helmut Kohl stands in front of an election poster, June 26, 1975, during an election campaign for the West German 1976 general election.\nBorn in Bavaria in 1930, Kohl's father and older brother served in World War II; his brother died in the war while still a teenager. Kohl joined the Hitler Youth at age 15, like most German boys his age, and was briefly put to work unearthing bodies after Allied bombing raids.\nShortly after the end of the war, Kohl joined the newly formed Christian Democratic Union, helped found the party's youth organization, and thus began a life of public service.\nHe rose to Germany's highest office through a series of local positions, championing domestic policies such as education reform and transportation.\nElected chancellor in 1982, he lost no time in reaching out to repair Germany's diplomatic relationships strained by the two world wars and their aftermath.\nFILE - Helmut Kohl (R) stands hand in hand with former French President Francois Mitterrand (L), Sept. 22, 1984, during their visit to the former Verdun battlefields.\nIn 1984, he and then-French President Francois Mitterand shook hands at an emotional remembrance ceremony of the Battle of Verdun, a long, brutal struggle between French and German forces in northeastern France during World War I. The meeting cemented a close political relationship between the two men even as it symbolized reconciliation between the two nations.\nKohl used the same gesture to make amends with the United States two years later, meeting with U.S. President Ronald Reagan at a G-7 summit in Bonn in 1985.\nThe visit was not universally praised, however, as the two leaders paid a joint visit to a German military cemetery where a number of Nazi officers were buried alongside German soldiers. The two also visited the site of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp together, paying tribute to the Jewish victims of Germany's ugly past.\nFILE German Chancellor Helmut Kohl walks with retired German Air Force General Johannes Steinhoff (frt) and former President Ronald Reagan accompanied by retired U.S. General Matthew Ridgway through the German military cemetary in Bitburg, May 5 1985.\nReconciliation\nAs the crescendo of reconciliation continued to rise, Kohl met in 1987 with East German leader Erich Honecker, the first time the leaders of East and West Germany sat down together since the country was split between democracy and communism at the end of World War II. The stage was set for the pinnacle of Kohl's career and a turning point in German history.\nWhen an East German official announced in November 1989 that all East Germans could travel freely to the West, Kohl lost no time in pushing forward with his reunification proposals. He met with Soviet Union President Mikhail Gorbachev in February 1990 to gain approval for his plan, and by October of that year, both halves of Germany had voted to become one again.\nKohl's popularity was at a high. But over his next two terms, the difficult reality of merging the communist east with the capitalist west had taken their toll on the economy and e unemployment rate. Kohl was voted out in 1998.\nThe years following were not so rosy. The Christian Democratic Union was damaged by revelations that it had accepted illegal campaign donations. Kohl first denied taking any illicit funds, but later admitted to receiving millions of deutschmarks in illegal donations and declined to name the donors of the funds.\nIn 2001, Kohl's wife, Hannelore, the East German he married in 1960, committed suicide. Some said her long battle with photosensitivity was to blame; others said it was her husband's financial scandal.\nSeven years later, Kohl suffered a debilitating stroke and soon thereafter married his female companion, Maike Richter, who was 35 years his junior. His health continued to suffer.\nCriticisms\nKohl's relationships with his political successors began to suffer, too, as he began speaking out against their policies toward the end of his life.\nEven Merkel, once his prot\u00e9g\u00e9e, was not spared his barbs. After airing his grievances in a book titled \"Out of Concern For Europe,\" Kohl was quoted in the press saying, \"That woman is destroying my Europe!\"\nHelmut Kohl, former German Chancellor sits in front of a large photograph of himself during a news conference to promote his new book, 'Erinnerungen 1982-1990' (Memories 1982-1990) in Berlin, Nov. 2, 2005.\nYet, at the end, Kohl was hailed not just as the man who helped Germany heal, but also one of the architects of European integration. He had a long list of awards for his work, including the Vision for Europe award for his reunification achievements, the Charlemagne Prize with Francois Mitterand for their contribution to Franco-German relations, and the Henry Kissinger Prize for exceptional contributions to transatlantic relations.\nKohl was also named Honorary Citizen of Europe by the European heads of state for his work on European integration.\nEuropean Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker ordered flags at EC headquarters in Brussels to fly at half-staff after news Friday of Kohl's death. He called Kohl \"my mentor, my friend, the very essence of Europe.\"\nKohl's political party, the Christian Democratic Union, tweeted: \"We mourn. #RIP #Helmut Kohl.\"\nFlowers sit in front of the house of former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Oggersheim, Germany, June 16, 2017.\n\n            ",

He drew parallels with the Arab Spring uprisings in Africa and the Middle East and protests in Ukraine that toppled a Russia-friendly president in 2014.\n\"Everybody should act in political processes within the framework of the law. All those who go outside this law should bear punishment in accordance with Russian legislation,\" Putin said.\nThe protests have shaken Russia's sleepy political scene and reinvigorated the opposition after years of relentless official crackdown, showing public readiness to brave draconian laws which make repeated participation in unsanctioned protests punishable with prison terms and hefty fines. \nFILE - Police detain a protester in downtown Moscow, Russia, March 26, 2017.\nIn contrast with the past, when opposition demonstrations were mostly limited to Moscow and St. Petersburg, Sunday's rallies engulfed dozens of provincial cities and towns.

By 16, she was a skinhead spouting white supremacist rhetoric, giving stiff-armed Nazi salutes and tagging public property with swastikas. She favored racist fashion statements \u2014 like the symbol on her right calf.\nFortified by the love of an adopted family, Martinez left the skinheads behind. Today she's helping others do the same as part of an emerging U.S. movement that helps people quit hate organizations.\nModeled loosely upon organizations that formed in Europe years ago to combat extremism, groups and individuals are offering counseling, education and understanding to extremists seeking a way out.\nLife After Hate\nNow a 42-year-old mom who homeschools her kids at their house in Georgia, Martinez volunteers with Life After Hate, a leading organization dedicated to helping people leave white supremacy. On Facebook, she shares her story with others who've left or are looking to leave extremism.\nChristian Picciolini, founder of the group Life After Hate, poses for a photograph in his Chicago home, Jan. 9, 2017. Picciolini, a former skinhead, is an activist combatting what many see as a surge in white nationalism across the United States. He's doing it by helping members quit groups including the Ku Klux Klan and skinhead organizations.\n\"We act as a group of people who understand each other,\" said former skinhead Christian Picciolini, an old friend of Martinez who founded the Chicago-based Life After Hate. \"We understand the motivations of where we came from and why we joined. We understand what keeps people in. And we help each other detach and disengage from that ideology and provide a support system for them as they go through that transformation.\"\nFounded in 2009, Life After Hate was awarded a $400,000 Justice Department grant in the closing days of the Obama administration \u2014 funding that could be endangered if the Trump administration decides to refocus a federal program combatting violent extremism solely on Islamic radicals, as is being considered.\nLeaving hate behind\nWhile several other grant recipients are dedicated to countering radical Muslim ideology, Life After Hate concentrates specifically on showing white extremists there's another way.\nThe group operates a website where people who want to explore leaving white extremism can submit contact information. It also conducts educational and counseling programs including the Facebook group where members sometimes chat with extremists trying to change their lives, Picciolini said.\n\"I started the organization ... because it was so difficult to leave that movement,\" he said. \"Even though I'd abandoned the ideology, I wasn't ready to give up my community and my power and my identity, and I knew how hard it would be for other people to leave this type of ideology or this type of movement.\"\nAnother group, One People's Project, was started by Daryle Lamont Jenkins of Philadelphia. Aside from monitoring racist groups, Jenkins \u2014 who is black \u2014 confronts white nationalists at public gatherings and talks one-on-one with willing white supremacists as he can, trying to show them there's a way other than hate. Some have never met a black person, he said.\nIn this Saturday, April 23, 2016 photo, members of the Ku Klux Klan participate in cross burnings after a \"white pride\" rally in rural Paulding County near Cedar Town, Ga. Born in the ashes of the smoldering South after the Civil War, the KKK died and was reborn before losing the fight against civil rights in the 1960s. Membership dwindled, a unified group fractured, and one-time members went to prison for a string of murderous attacks against blacks. Many assumed the group was dead, a white-robed ghost of hate and violence.\nJenkins' work is similar to that of Daryl Davis, a black musician from Maryland who has gained notice for trying to talk people out of the Ku Klux Klan.\nMark Potok, a senior fellow with the liberal Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Alabama, said it's hard to determine exact numbers, but around 100,000 people might be members in hate groups and several hundred thousand could be linked informally.\nPotok said exit organizations began in Europe in the 1980s to counter the rise right-wing militants there.\n\"I do think that this is a particularly important moment for this kind of exit work to be happening because we have seen in the last year, year and a half, a real legitimization of these views,\" he said.\nPresident Donald Trump's election with the support of neo-Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan has lent a new sense of urgency to opponents of white supremacy.\n\"The Trump election has absolutely lit a fire under the butts of the white nationalists,\" Martinez said. \"It is like, 'Our time is coming.'\"\nFormer skinhead Shannon Martinez, left, talks with some of her children in their home in Athens, Georgia, Jan. 11, 2017. A member of the racist group starting in her teen years, Martinez quit decades ago and is now worried about a possible rise in extremism in the United States.\nMartinez said she grew up in metro Atlanta in a relatively normal family but rebelled after being sexually assaulted at a party. She got involved in the punk scene, which led to the skinhead movement.\nMartinez said she was on a path to prison or an early death when she moved in with the family of her skinhead boyfriend, who was away for Army training. His mother showed unconditional love that pulled her out of the abyss, Martinez said.\nToday, she looks at photos of herself from her skinhead days and fights back tears.\n\"I was filled with rage and anger and the skinheads were the angriest people that I knew and I was kind of like, 'Those are my people.' And the ideology was a means of taking something that was ethereal, something that was unnamable, an anger and a rage that I felt, and giving it a focal point,\" she said.\nShane Johnson was born into extremism. His father and many of his father's relatives were part of the Klan, he said, so there was only one real way for him to go as a youth in northern Indiana.\nShane Johnson poses with his dogs outside his home in Tippecanoe, Indiana, Jan. 12, 2017. Johnson was born into extremism. He eventually joined a skinhead group in addition to the KKK but finally decided to quit after getting arrested, stopping drinking and meeting the woman who is now his wife. Leaving was a real fight, though, as even relatives jumped him at a gas station one night after learning he wanted to quit.\n\"We were known as the Klan family,\" he said. \"I got my first Klan robe when I was 14.\"\nJohnson eventually joined a skinhead group in addition to the KKK but finally decided to quit after getting arrested, stopping drinking and meeting the woman who is now his wife. Leaving was a real fight, though, as even relatives jumped him at a gas station one night after learning he wanted to quit.\n\"When I dropped out they beat the holy hell out of me,\" he said.\nSince then, Johnson has tried to cover some of his racist tattoos with new ones and wears long sleeves to hide remnants of the past he regrets. Life After Hate is helping him numerous ways, Johnson said, including showing him how to read the Bible without seeing it as a treatise on racial separation, as he had been taught.\nJohnson, now 25 and living in rural Indiana, isn't ready to begin counseling others about leaving extremism; he still sometimes longs for his racist buddies and their ways. But he said his own story is proof that hate doesn't have to be permanent.\n\"You can get out,\" he said.\n\n            ",

Instead, the government pays Nauru and Papua New Guinea to house them in conditions condemned by human-rights groups.\n\u201cWe know who our friends are, and we know it is great to work alongside you in our fight against people smuggling,\u201d Waqa told Turnbull ahead of their meeting. \u201cI think the program is working well.\u201d\nNauru\nFuture of program in doubt\nBut the future of the program remains in doubt, following a spat it prompted between Australia and the U.S.\nLast year, Australia said it would take in an unspecified number of Hondurans and Salvadorans from a U.S.-led program to resettle refugees currently in a camp in Costa Rica. Shortly after, the Obama administration said the U.S. would accept up to 1,250 refugees living on Nauru and Papua New Guinea who have been rejected by Australia for attempting to arrive by boat.\nPresident Donald Trump was infuriated by the deal, which led to a tense phone conversation with Turnbull that strained ties between the two countries. Trump later tweeted that the agreement was \"dumb.\" He ultimately, albeit reluctantly, agreed to honor the deal, but has said the refugees will be subjected to \"extreme vetting.\" There are few details on what that means.\nNo questions\nWaqa and Turnbull did not take questions from journalists ahead of their meeting, offering only brief comments of praise for each other.\n\u201cI want to thank you for the great cooperation that Nauru shows in working together with us to combat this scourge of people smuggling,\u201d Turnbull told Waqa. \u201cYour efforts in collaboration are so appreciated.\u201d\nWaqa will also meet with Foreign Minister Julie Bishop on Thursday, and will meet with officials in Canberra and Brisbane later this week.\n\n            ",

However, he generally dismissed such theatrics as \"a part of politics.\"\nDialogue 'is what matters'\n\"I heard what I heard during the private discussions, in formal and informal discussions,\" de Mistura said. \"I had a feeling that the sides want to find a dialogue. That is what matters.\"\n\"And,\" he added, \"that gives me some feeling that we are moving in the right direction.\"\nDe Mistura will travel to New York to report on the talks to the U.N. secretary-general and the Security Council. While there, he said, he hoped to set a date to resume the next round of Syrian talks this month.\nWhen the parties return to Geneva, he said, they will be pursuing a framework agreement based on Security Council Resolution 2254, which forms the basis for a political transition to a postwar government.\nThis formula contains three \"baskets\" of issues to be fleshed out: credible, nonsectarian governance; the drafting of a new constitution; and free and fair elections under U.N. supervision.\nFILE - People inspect the damage at a site hit by a barrel bomb in the rebel-held area of Old Aleppo, Syria, July 11, 2016.\nDebate over 'terrorism'\nDe Mistura said the government and opposition delegations also agreed to include a fourth \"basket\" of issues, addressing \"strategies related to counterterrorism, security governance and medium-term confidence building measures.\"\nThe Damascus government's delegation in Geneva reportedly had insisted that anti-terrorism measures must be added to the agenda as a condition for continuing negotiations. \nSyrian opposition groups initially objected to this provision, but later agreed to go along after de Mistura reportedly assured them that the government's use of barrel bombs and chemical weapons against civilian targets would be part of the discussions.\nSyria's six-year civil war has taken a heavy toll in lives lost, people displaced and infrastructure destroyed. More than 400,000 people have been killed, and more than 11 million have been displaced, either within the country or as refugees abroad. Well over half of Syria's population of nearly 23 million needs humanitarian assistance.\nMilitary solution a 'fantasy'\nDespite this dismal picture, the U.N. envoy acknowledged there were still people in Syria who believed in the possibility of a military solution to this crisis.\n\"That is fantasy,\" he declared. \"Only a political solution \u2014 but a political solution that addresses the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian people \u2014 can solve this crisis.\"\nDe Mistura said he was looking forward to the fifth round of intra-Syrian talks and thought that \"we have prepared everyone to actually engage not only on methodology, but also on substance\" regarding the four \"baskets\" of issues.\n\"The train is ready. It is in the station. It is warming up its engine,\" he said. \"Everything is ready. It just needs an accelerator, and the accelerator is in the hands of those who were attending this round.\"\n\n            ",

Butt was a British citizen who was born in Pakistan, moving with his parents to Britain as a toddler. Police admitted he was known to counterterror officers and the intelligence services, but officials insist there was no sign he was planning an attack.\nThe other named attacker was Rachid Redouane, 30. He claimed he was a Moroccan-Libyan and lived for several years in Ireland.\nAssistant Police Commissioner Mark Rowley said an investigation into Butt began two years ago, but \"there was no intelligence to suggest that this attack was being planned and the investigation had been prioritized accordingly.\"\nFILE - Forensics investigators work as a white van is carried away from London Bridge, after attackers rammed a hired van into pedestrians on London Bridge and stabbed others nearby killing and injuring people, in London, Britain, June 4, 2017.\nThe two men's names were released as Britain's security services are facing awkward questions about their surveillance policies.\nButt was a recognized Islamic State follower in the streets around his home in the Barking district, where he tried to recruit children and proselytized openly in a nearby park, sparking a complaint to police by a local resident. \nButt also appeared in a television documentary last year in which he was pictured unfurling an Islamic State banner and later arguing with police during a London protest organized by radical preacher Anjem Choudary, a convicted IS recruiter.\nInsufficient response\nLast month, community and mosque leaders in Manchester and neighbors of Salman Abedi, the British-Libyan who carried out the May 22 concert bombing in the city, accused the security services of missing several opportunities to identify him as a high-risk militant. At least five times, locals warned the police of their fears about the 22-year-old suicide bomber. One community worker said he contacted authorities after Abedi said being a suicide bomber was OK.\nForensic police investigate an area in the London Bridge area of London, June 5, 2017.\nNeither Britain's domestic intelligence service MI5 nor the Manchester police responded to the claims, but lawmakers have demanded to know why Abedi was seen just as a peripheral figure and one not requiring surveillance and investigation.\nSimilar questions are being raised again in the wake of the van-and-knife attack in the London Bridge district of Britain's capital. \nButt's parents are reported to have been asylum seekers from Pakistan. According to local media, the man, nicknamed Abz, worked at various times for a fast-food outlet, a clothing store and the London Underground system. \nA onetime friend of the alleged ringleader also told the BBC that he had warned police, alerting them to comments made about previous terrorist attacks in Britain and of his alarm at the man's increasingly extremist beliefs. The former friend said Butt was a keen follower of American radical preacher Ahmad Musa Jibril and would watch YouTube videos of the cleric.\n\"He used to listen to a lot of Musa Jibril,\" the ex-friend told the BBC. \"I phoned the anti-terror hotline. I spoke to the gentleman. I told him about our conversation and why I think he was radicalized ... I did my bit, I know a lot of other people did their bit, but the authorities did not do their bit.\"\nSecurity strategy review\nA senior Conservative official told VOA that there is deep frustration in Downing Street about Saturday's attack and the fact that at least one of the assailants was known to the authorities. Prime Minister Theresa May promised to review Britain's counterterrorism strategy, holding out the prospects of enhanced powers for the security services and longer jail sentences for extremists. She said she wants to take a tougher line with internet providers and social media businesses that allow extremist material on their sites.\nCommuters walk past a police officer on London Bridge in London, June 5, 2017.\nAmong the measures being recommended by security chiefs, according to government officials, is the power to require those on terror watch lists to wear electronic tags, a ban on the sale of unregistered SIM cards, and a ban on immediate vehicle rentals, requiring renters to wait two hours and for rental firms to run checks on them with the police.\nPolice and counterterror officers launched further raids early Monday in east London. A police spokesman said \"a number\" of people had been detained. Local residents reported hearing bangs and gunshots during the raids. On Sunday, police arrested 12 people \u2014 seven women and five men \u2014 in connection with Saturday's terror attack. One of the men has since been released from custody.\n\n            ",

President Park\u2019s sudden downfall was caused by a domestic scandal, her alleged connection to a multi-million dollar influence bribery scheme involving top Korean conglomerates.\nBut the upcoming election is also expected to be a referendum on Park\u2019s hardline foreign policy positions to deal with the increasing North Korean nuclear threat through coercive pressure only, using increased economic sanctions and military deterrence.\nProtesters with portraits of impeached President Park Geun-hye march towards the presidential house during a candle light vigil calling for her arrest in Seoul, South Korea, March 11, 2017.\nUnited front\nThis week, Tillerson is likely to see only scenes of unity when he visits with American military forces in South Korea engaged in joint exercises, that include the nuclear powered aircraft carrier the USS Carl Vinson, in a show of force to counter North Korea\u2019s advancing nuclear and missile capabilities.\nNorth Korea has warned it would launch \"merciless\" attacks if the carrier infringes on its sovereignty or dignity during the drills.\nTillerson will also likely hear only words of support for U.S. policy when he meets with Acting President Hwang Kyo-ahn and South Korean Foreign Affairs Minister Yun Byung-Se. Both conservative interim officials echo the U.S. on the need to increase North Korean sanctions to pressure the Kim Jong Un government to dismantle its' nuclear arsenal in return for security guarantees and economic aid.\nAny compromise in this position, many conservatives say, will only legitimize North Korea as a nuclear state.\nThae Young Ho, the former deputy head of the North Korean Embassy in London until he defected to the South last year, argues further that any negotiations are futile because North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will never give up his nuclear arsenal.\n\u201cI am absolutely sure that the only way to solve the North Korean nuclear issue fundamentally is the elimination of the Kim Jong Un regime,\u201d said Thae.\nA Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) interceptor is launched during a successful intercept test, in this undated photo provided by the U.S. Department of Defense.\nTHAAD\nBoth sides will likely voice strong support for increased deterrence, especially the controversial THAAD missile defense system that can potentially intercept a nuclear-armed North Korea ballistic missile at a high altitude.\nWashington and Seoul have both defended THAAD, as well as expanding the scale of joint military drills in South Korea, as a necessary security measures in the face of North Korea\u2019s numerous ballistic missile launches and nuclear tests conducted in the last year.\nBoth also want to resolve through talks China\u2019s strong opposition to THAAD as an unnecessary and provocative military escalation, and its concern that the system\u2019s powerful radar could be used to monitor others in the region. Beijing is reportedly retaliating by restricting the operations of some South Korean companies, and limiting imports and tourist visas.\nFor some advocates, THAAD has become an issue of maintaining national sovereignty in the face of Chinese pressure, as much as it is a needed defensive measure.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to find out whether the South Koreans are willing to give up their sovereign right to defend themselves and if South Korea is willing to accept becoming the Chinese vassal,\u201d said Grant Newsham with the Japan Forum for Strategic Studies in Tokyo.\nThe Democratic Party's candidates for the presidential primary Moon Jae-in, Choi Sung and Lee Jae-myung (R-L) attend an event to declare their fair contest in the party's presidential primary in Seoul, March 14, 2017.\nSouth Korea first\nBut while the U.S. priority may be to prevent North Korea from developing a nuclear-armed long-range missile that could reach the American mainland, liberals in South Korea want to first reduce the risk of war on the Korean Peninsula.\nMoon Jae-in, the leading presidential candidate from the Democratic Party of Korea, wants to take a less confrontational approach to deal with the current reality, rather than hoping for the collapse of the Kim government.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t deny that the ruler of the North Korean people is Kim Jong Un. We have no choice but to recognize Kim Jong Un as a counterpart, whether we put pressure and impose sanctions on North Korea or hold dialogue,\u201d said Moon.\nThe liberal presidential candidates also value the strong U.S. military alliance and support international sanctions on North Korea, but they argue that the punitive-only approach has failed to force North Korea to the negotiating table. In fact, they point out, Pyongyang has accelerated nuclear and ballistic missile testing at an unprecedented rate in the last year despite the increased international sanctions imposed on them.\nLiberal leaders advocate a return to engagement polices that might rebuild trust and reduce tensions through exchanges and selective economic aid and joint ventures.While the South Korean Sunshine policy of engagement that began at the turn of the century ultimately failed to stop the North from developing nuclear weapons, they argue it did have some success in slowing the pace of progress. Advocates say it may be worth the effort to try again, to focus on fostering long-term peaceful internal change through economic interaction.\n\u201cYou got to be really honest and accepting what has not been working, and what has been working, and try to see a new approach,\u201d said Bong Young-shik with the Yonsei University Institute for North Korean Studies in Seoul.\nSome leading opposition candidates also oppose THAAD as an American military escalation aimed at China that would do little to protect South Korea from the thousands of missiles and artillery North Korea has already in position near the border.\nKeeping China as an engaged economic and diplomatic partner, they say, is more in South Korea\u2019s interest than siding with the U.S. on THAAD.\nThe South Korean liberal coalition won the majority in the National Assembly last year, and is ahead in presidential election public opinion polls.\nYoumi Kim contributed to this report\n\n            ",

Shen, 60, replaced outgoing naval commander Wu Shengli, 71, who was described by another state-run paper, the Global Times, as having stepped down after reaching retirement age.\nWu still retains his position on the powerful Central Military Commission, the China Daily said, but added that his new duties were unclear.\nIn its fleet-building efforts, state media have said, the PLA Navy commissioned 18 ships in 2016, including missile destroyers, corvettes and guided missile frigates, and has said it is building a second aircraft carrier.\nRegional naval officials say Chinese ships now increasingly track and shadow U.S. and Japanese warships in the contested South China and East China seas, even during routine deployments.\nChina says it has no hostile intent and wants to manage the disputes through two-way talks with the other claimants. But Beijing has been involved in a diplomatic spat with Washington over ship and aircraft patrols in the region.\nChina claims almost of the energy-rich South China Sea, through which about $5 trillion in ship-borne trade passes every year, and has been building up military facilities, such as runways, on the islands it controls.\nBrunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also have claims.\n\n            ",

It covers an arc of 65 countries reaching from the South Pacific through South and Central Asia to Europe and Africa.\nThe initiative would provide some of the $7 trillion of investment in infrastructure the Asian Development Bank says the region needs this decade. But governments including Russia, the United States and India are uneasy that China is using its status as the second-largest global economy to expand its political influence.\nXi insisted his government has \u201cno desire to impose our will on others.\u201d But he also called for economic integration and cooperation on financial regulation, anti-terrorism and security \u2014 all fields in which China\u2019s economic heft would give it a prominent voice.\n\u201cWe should foster a vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security and create a security environment built and shared by all,\u201d Xi said.

The launch was seen as a challenge to a new South Korean president who was elected last week and came as U.S., Japanese and European naval forces gathered for war games in the Pacific.\nChinese President Xi Jinping speaks during the opening ceremony of the Belt and Road Forum at the China National Convention Center in Beijing, May 14, 2017. Xi offered tens of billions of dollars for projects that are part of his signature foreign policy initiative linking China to much of Asia, Europe and Africa.\nXi foreign policy initiative\nThe \u201cBelt and Road\u201d is Xi\u2019s signature foreign policy initiative. The two-day meeting that started Sunday gives him a platform to promote his image as a global leader and an advocate of free trade in contrast to President Donald Trump, who has called for import restrictions.\nXi said Beijing will contribute an additional 100 billion yuan ($14.5 billion) to the Silk Road Fund set up in 2014 to finance infrastructure projects. He said his government will provide aid worth 60 billion yuan ($8.7 billion) to developing countries and international organizations.\nTwo Chinese government-run banks also will set up lending facilities valued at a total of 380 billion yuan ($55 billion) to support the initiative, Xi said.\nPutin sees danger in protectionism\nSpeaking after Xi, Putin echoed the Chinese president\u2019s theme that economic development would help to nurture political stability. The Russian leader said the rise of trade protectionism is creating a \u201cbreeding ground for international extremism and terrorism.\u201d\n\u201cRussia believes that the future of the Eurasian partnership is not just about fostering ties between a few countries and economies,\u201d Putin said. \u201cIt should change the very political and economic landscape of the continent bringing Eurasia stability, prosperity.\u201d\nXi said Beijing plans to announce dozens of new investment and other agreements during the two-day event.\nNo major Western leaders\nOther leaders at the gathering included Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan and President Michelle Bachelet of Chile. No major Western leaders attended, though Britain, France and Germany were represented by top finance officials.\nThe U.S. delegation was led by Matt Pottinger, special assistant to Trump and senior director for East Asia at the National Security Council.\nThe United States and other governments have said \u201cBelt and Road\u201d is a natural outgrowth of China\u2019s status as the biggest global trader and they welcome the investment. But they also have expressed concern Beijing might undermine human rights and international standards for lending or leave poor countries with too much debt.\nMost of the Chinese financing is loans, instead of grants.\nInternational Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde speaks during the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in Beijing, May 14, 2017.\nIndia criticism\nIndia delivered an implicit criticism of China\u2019s initiative Saturday in a statement that said such an initiative should meet international norms and not create unsustainable debt.\nIndia has objected to Chinese state-owned companies working in the Pakistani-held part of Kashmir, the Himalayan region claimed by both sides. New Delhi sees that as an endorsement of Pakistan\u2019s control.\n\u201cNo country can accept a project that ignores its core concerns on sovereignty and territorial integrity,\u201d the statement said.\nSome diplomats and political analysts say Beijing is trying to create a political and economic network centered on China, push the United States out of the region and rewrite rules on trade and security.\nXi promised to avoid forming a \u201csmall group\u201d of allies, which he said might harm regional stability.\nInstead, he said, Beijing wants \u201cpartnerships of friendship\u201d and a \u201cbig family of harmonious coexistence.\u201d\n\n            ",

The conference in Kampala hopes to raise $8 billion to support refugees in Uganda for the next four years.\nAt the border separating Uganda from South Sudan, exhausted women and children arrive daily, hungry and dehydrated. Aid workers give them fortified biscuits.\nUganda hosts 1.2 million refugees from at least five African countries. Nearly one million have fled the conflict in South Sudan, and most have arrived in the past year. The local food supply is stretched to the limit.\nThe U.N. World Food Program was forced to cut food rations to refugees last month, says WFP country representative El Khidir Daloum.\n\"Yes, we have been forced to reduce the distribution for the month of May by 50 percent, but that is mainly due to the physical availability of food and arrival of food in the country,\u201d he said.\nFunding is also inadequate.\nThe United Nations and 57 other aid organizations working in northern Uganda, appealed for $1.4 billion to provide food and shelter this year, but only 18 percent of the funds has been received.\nAmnesty International researchers visited the refugee settlements in Uganda and Deputy Regional Director Michelle Kagari says the refugees have already suffered greatly.\n\"There is one woman who has nine children, her and her children witness their father being killed, not to mention the trauma of fleeing the Equatoria's,\" she said.

Attacker Khalid Masood is believed to have used the messaging service WhatsApp before running down pedestrians on Westminster Bridge and stabbing to death a policeman.\nBritain's security services are in a standoff with WhatsApp, which has refused to allow them access to the encrypted message the London attacker sent three minutes before he used an SUV to mow down pedestrians on Westminster Bridge and stabbed to death a policeman outside the House of Commons.\nBritish security services are powerless to read that final message, which might cast light on whether the attack was a \"lone wolf\" or one aided and directed by others. Police investigators believe the terrorist acted alone and have seen no evidence that he was associated with IS or al-Qaida.\nWhatsApp, which has a billion users worldwide, employs \"end to end encryption\" for messages, which the company says prevents even its own technicians from reading people's messages.\nOfficials want voluntary action\nRudd and other government ministers have launched a media onslaught, saying they are considering legislation to require online companies to take down extremist material. They argue this wouldn't be necessary if the companies recognized their community responsibilities.\nFILE - Britain's Home Secretary Amber Rudd speaks during a vigil in Trafalgar Square, London, March 23, 2017.\nRudd told the BBC that Facebook, Google and other companies should understand they are not just technology businesses, but also publishing platforms. \"We have to have a situation where we can have our security services get into the terrorists' communications,\" she argued. \"There should be no place for terrorists to hide.\"\nBritish Foreign Minister Boris Johnson joined in the condemnation of social media and online companies. \"I think it's disgusting,\" he told The Sunday Times. \"They need to stop just making money out of prurient violent material.\"\nAt a security conference last week in the United States, Johnson called for action.\n\"We are going to have to engage not just militarily, but also to stop the stuff on the internet that is corrupting and polluting so many people,\" he said. \"This is something that the internet companies and social media companies need to think about. They need to do more to take that stuff off their media \u2014 the incitements, the information about how to become a terrorist, the radicalizing sermons and messages. That needs to come down.\"\nRecruiting criminals\nThe furor over extremist use of the internet was fueled Monday by front-page articles in the Times and Daily Mail newspapers highlighting the IS propaganda videos posted on YouTube since last Wednesday's slaughter in the British capital. The high-definition videos, some of which contained references to the London attack, include gory scenes of beheadings and \"caliphate violence\" carried out by child adherents of the terror group.\nFILE - In this photo released on April 25, 2015 by a militant website, which has been verified and is consistent with other AP reporting, young boys known as the \"lion cubs\" hold rifles during a parade after graduating from a religious school in Tal Afar, Iraq.\nU.S. and European officials have long complained online companies are, in effect, aiding and abetting terrorism. A year ago in January, much of the U.S. national security leadership of the Obama administration sat down with Silicon Valley chiefs to discuss jihadist use of the internet to recruit and radicalize people and plot attacks.\nAlso last year, British spy chief, Robert Hannigan, singled out messaging apps as especially worrisome for the security services, saying they had become \"the command-and-control networks of choice for terrorists and criminals \u2014 precisely because they are highly encrypted.\"\nSome cooperation\nAfter initial resistance to complaints from Western governments, Facebook, Google and Twitter have in recent months been more cooperative with authorities and have removed large amounts of extremist material. Twitter said in the second half of 2016 it suspended 376,890 accounts for violations related to promotion of terrorism.\nBut some services have resisted providing governments with encryption keys, or so-called back doors.\nApple has developed encryption keys that message users can use that are not possessed by the company. Apple's chief executive, Timothy Cook, argued last year, \"If you put a key under the mat for the cops, a burglar can find it, too.\"\nSilicon Valley chiefs say they fear violations of privacy and their priority is their customers, not national security, an argument that has resonated since former U.S. National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden revealed the extent of electronic surveillance by U.S. intelligence agencies.\nLast year, WhatsApp was blocked several times in Brazil for failing to hand over information relating to criminal investigations. \nMessages sent on a rival service by Telegram are also encrypted, but after bad publicity and immense pressure from Western governments, the company does provide a backdoor for security and law-enforcement agencies.\nNot that access to encrypted communications always helps.\nSunday, it emerged that German police knew the Christmas market attacker in Berlin who drove a truck into a crowd of shoppers was planning a suicide attack. Police had intercepted his Telegram messages nine months before the attack.\nA police recommendation that he be deported was declined by state government prosecutors because they feared the courts would reject the request.\n\n            ",

The stakes are so high.\u201d\nThose unveiling the 2017 clock told reporters the rhetoric of newly-inaugurated Trump to impede progress in nuclear disarmament and climate change was a key factor in deciding the time change. \nThe new president, they acknowledge, also can single-handedly help send the hands of the Doomsday Clock moving backward to safety.\nProviding an \u2018opening\u2019\n\"We have to give him the opening,\" former U.S. ambassador to Russia Thomas Pickering told VOA when asked whether he believes Trump will be swayed by news of the clock's advance to midnight. \"Hopefully he will hear\" the suggestions from scientists and others advocating a re-start of arms reduction talks with Russia and raising the alarm about the effects of climate change.\nOther factors affecting the clock's movement this year are the growing risks from cyberattacks and emerging technologies in life sciences. \nThe Doomsday Clock has faced criticism over the decades as more art than science. Its \"back and forth\" movement is ridiculed, while the scientists behind it are labeled scaremongers.\n\"When it comes to nuclear weapons people have become complacent,\" Krauss told VOA. \"So we owe it to the world to risk being labeled scaremongers just to encourage people to think about the problem.\"\nThe Doomsday Clock was created in 1947 by a group of concerned scientists who had been involved with the top secret Manhattan Project, which built the first nuclear weapons, as a response to nuclear threats. \nSince then, the minute hand of the clock has moved backwards and forwards. Its closest warning of apocalypse was amid the commencement of atmospheric thermonuclear weapons testing in 1953 by the United States and Soviet Union.\nThe farthest the hands have moved from midnight was in 1991 when the clock read 11:43 p.m. following the Threshold Test Ban Treaty entering into force.\n\n            ",

On his first stop in Malaysia, Saudi Aramco signed a $7 billion deal to take a 50 percent stake in a Malaysian oil refinery. Salman will also visit Brunei, Japan, China and the Maldives, the official Saudi Press Agency has reported.\nThe first visit of a Saudi monarch to Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation, in nearly a half century generated blanket media coverage.\nLive broadcasts showed the octogenarian Salman exiting his plane at Halim using a gold-colored escalator sent from Saudi Arabia for the visit, with a portable lift carrying him the final meter or so to the ground.\nSalman will spend six of his nine days in Indonesia vacationing on the resort island of Bali, a predominantly Hindu part of the Indonesian archipelago.\n\"As the world's biggest Muslim nation, Indonesia will always have a special bond with Saudi Arabia,\" said Jokowi. \"Indonesia and Saudi Arabia are two big countries that have important influence in the region, and our countries should continue to improve cooperation both in bilateral and international contexts.\"\nIndonesia practices a moderate form of Islam and has a democratic secular government, but Saudi-funded institutes in the country are known to spread a highly doctrinaire interpretation of the Quran. They are tolerated in part because Indonesia wants to at least maintain its annual quota of citizens who can enter Saudi Arabia to participate in the hajj to Islam's holiest city.\nJokowi said he appreciated that Indonesia's hajj quota, which was reduced in the aftermath of the 2015 hajj disasters, had been restored and expanded for 2017 with 221,000 pilgrims allowed from Indonesia.\nThe Indonesian government said Salman's entourage and related delegations number about 1,500 people. They have booked out four hotels in a posh Jakarta neighborhood for the week and about 10,000 police and soldiers have been deployed for security, including for Salman's Bali trip.\nStatues of naked men and women at the Bogor palace were removed or covered out of courtesy to the Saudi visitors. The same step was taken when Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe visited Indonesia in January.\nIndonesia has said it hopes for $25 billion of new investments from Saudi Arabia. The two leaders discussed possibilities including three oil refineries, a power plant and infrastructure such as roads, housing and sanitation.\nAside from the two countries having a common faith, Saudi Arabia employs hundreds of thousands of Indonesians despite a government ban on sending domestic workers there following the execution of an Indonesian maid in 2011.\n\n            ",

Prematurity rose by 2 percent in 2016 and by 1.6 percent the year before.\nStacey Stewart, president of the March of Dimes, a nonprofit U.S. group that works to eliminate prematurity and birth defects, called the increase \u201can alarming indication that the health of pregnant women and babies in our country is heading in the wrong direction.\u201d\nExpand health care\nStewart called on Washington to expand access to quality prenatal care and promote proven ways to help reduce the risk of preterm birth. Noting that the U.S. Senate is considering a health care bill that many Americans believe would reduce health benefits for poor families and change coverage for maternity and newborn care, Stewart said now \u201cis not the time to make it harder for women to get the care they need to have healthy pregnancies and healthy babies.\u201d\nIn the U.S., about 400,000 babies born each year before the 37th week of pregnancy are considered preterm. No one knows all the causes of prematurity, but researchers have discovered that even late-term \u201cpreemies\u201d face developmental challenges that full-term babies do not. Several studies show that health problems related to preterm births persist through adult life, problems such as chronic lung disease, developmental handicaps and vision and hearing losses.\nAfrican-American rates\nResearch also shows that African-American women are 48 percent more likely to bear a child prematurely than all other women. And African-American infants born with birth defects are much more likely to face severe outcomes, compared to other U.S. newborns.\nAfrican-American women in general are worse off than low-income white women, Stewart said.\n\u201cWe want to make sure that all babies have access to opportunities to be delivered at full term,\u201d she told VOA, \u201cthat mothers have the opportunity to have healthy pregnancies and deliver their babies full term, and we know we must do a much better job in African-American and Hispanic communities and in other communities of color,\u201d to make sure that solutions are available.\nThe report from the National Center for Health Statistics, which is part of the government\u2019s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, shows that preterm rates rose in 17 of the 50 U.S. states, and that none reported a decline.\nThe incidence of low birth weight, a risk factor for some serious health problems, also rose for a second straight year in 2016. Again, rates of low birth weight babies were higher for African-Americans than for other racial groups.\n\n            ",

Egyptian officials said a suicide car bomber had attacked a military checkpoint in northern Sinai earlier in the day.\nIn the wake of the attack, which occurred near the border town of Rafah, dozens of masked militants descended on the site in vehicles and shot at the 60 soldiers present with machine guns, security officials said.\nWhen the attack subsided, the militants apparently took weapons and ammunition from the checkpoint before fleeing, the officials said. Some militants were killed in the shootout, and some of their vehicles were abandoned.\nAccording to the IS statement, a second car bomber struck an army convoy sent to reinforce the embattled soldiers.

The veterans hope such accounts by former fighters will carry weight and spark public debate about the moral price of the occupation.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and top officials in his nationalist government have a starkly different view. They have branded Breaking the Silence as foreign-funded subversives who are trying to defame Israel and its military.\nMost recently, Netanyahu even seemed willing to rattle Israel's relationship with key European ally Germany to score points against Breaking the Silence, which has 16 paid staffers, several dozen volunteers and an annual budget of about $2 million.\nTwo weeks ago, he said he would not receive German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel if the visitor stuck to plans to meet with Breaking the Silence. Gabriel chose the soldiers instead. Netanyahu, who also serves as foreign minister, said that shunning visitors who meet with Breaking the Silence is now official policy.\nThe fallout continues this week. The dispute has cast a shadow over what would otherwise have been a routine Israel visit by German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier. Media reports suggest Steinmeier will praise the group during a speech Sunday, but not meet with its representatives to avoid another spat with Netanyahu.\nYehuda Shaul, a co-founder of Breaking the Silence, said the recent attention has been a mixed blessing.\nThe focus on the diplomatic dust-up \"diverts a lot of attention from the real issue, what goes on in the occupied territories,\" he said in an interview at the group's office, tucked away in an old walk-up in a grubby industrial area of Tel Aviv.\n\"On the other hand, it gives us more stages to speak about it,\" said Shaul, citing more media attention and public speaking invitations that draw larger audiences.\nIsraelis have been bitterly divided over what to do with the West Bank, Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem, lands they captured in June 1967. Israel annexed east Jerusalem immediately after the war and retains overall control over the West Bank, with enclaves of Palestinian self-rule. Israel unilaterally withdrew from Gaza in 2005 and has enforced a border blockade of the territory since it was seized by the Islamic militant Hamas two years later.\nMany Israelis support the idea of Palestinian statehood in principle, but believe it's not safe to cede war-won territories now. Fears were stoked by three Israel-Hamas wars since 2008 and an escalation of regional conflicts. Meanwhile, partition is increasingly difficult, with 600,000 Israelis already living on occupied lands and settlements expanding steadily.\nNetanyahu has said he is willing to resume partition talks with the Palestinians, but gaps remain wide. A majority of his Cabinet ministers oppose a two-state solution and some even call for annexing parts of the West Bank, raising fears among some Israelis that their rule over disenfranchised Palestinians will become permanent.\nShaul said he and his comrades are the true patriots, not those clinging to occupied territories.\n\"I believe Jews have a right to self-determination in the Holy Land. But I refuse to accept that the only way I will be allowed to implement my right to self-determination is if I strip my neighbors, the Palestinians, of the exact same right I demand for myself,\" he said. \"A permanent occupation is the most anti-Zionist position one can ever have because it says we are doomed to live in a sin.\"\nThe beginnings of Breaking the Silence go back to Hebron, the West Bank's largest Palestinian city, where hundreds of troops guard roughly the same number of Jewish settlers in an Israeli-controlled center partly off limits to Palestinians.\nShaul, who grew up in an Orthodox Jewish home, spent more than a year of his compulsory three-year army service in Hebron at the height of an armed Palestinian uprising of bombings and shootings that erupted in 2000.\nHe became increasingly disillusioned with his army mission, which he felt was largely aimed at making Palestinians fear him and his comrades. He said that while his parents and grandparents fought against armies to defend Israel, \"the stories I can tell you about is breaking into houses in the middle of the night to intimidate people and seeing children crying and peeing in their pants.''\nIn 2004, Shaul and dozens of members from his unit presented a photo exhibit about Hebron in Tel Aviv.\nSince then, the group has collected recorded testimony from hundreds of soldiers, including those who fought in recent Israel-Hamas wars. Some of the soldiers described an atmosphere in which the mission and safety of the troops trumped other considerations, such as the lives and property of Palestinians.\nMore than 100 soldiers have gone on the record, while the rest remain anonymous, for fear of repercussions, but are known to the group's researchers who check their stories, Shaul said. The research department was able to flag four false testimonies by right-wing activists trying to undermine the group's credibility, he said. All material is submitted to the military censor before publication to avoid inadvertent harm to Israel's security, he added.\nCritics allege that the group is hiding behind anonymous testimony to smear Israel soldiers and help Israel's enemies press future war crimes charges at the International Criminal Court. They say the group, which does not call for a boycott of Israel, nonetheless feeds into what many Israelis believe is a global trend of unfairly singling out and delegitimizing Israel.\nDeputy Foreign Minister Tzipi Hotovely recently said her office is urging European countries to stop funding what she called \"anti-Israel organizations,\" including Breaking the Silence. \"We will ask our friends in the world to respect this red line and to stop contributing to this organization,'\" she said.\nSome of the group's defenders in Israel said they believe it and other anti-occupation organizations are being targeted in an escalating government assault on Israel's civil society.\nAmos Oz, Israel's most famous living author, has said the ex-soldiers play a critical role in Israel's society, comparing them to biblical prophets who spoke uncomfortable truths. \"Moral impulse is a matter of utmost existential importance,\" Oz said in a November speech that media reports said would be cited by the German president.\n\n            ",

He said it took him two-and-a-half years to get a license and that did not give him a very good image of the EU.\u201d\nGerman officials told S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung that Trump and his aides were under the impression America had separate trade deals with each individual EU country.\n'America First' message\nFrance\u2019s Le Monde newspaper said: \u201cDuring this visit, President Trump maintained his line \u2018America First,\u2019 refusing to take a step to improve U.S.-European relations.\u201d It faulted him for failing to make a clear statement reaffirming Article 5 of the NATO Treaty, guaranteeing mutual assistance in the event of armed attack, and for lecturing European leaders on financial burden-sharing.\nFrom left, British Prime Minister Theresa May, U.S. President Donald Trump and NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg listen to Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel as he speaks during a working dinner meeting at the NATO headquarters during a NATO summit.\nThe German magazine Der Spiegel pounced on the closing photo-op of a midweek meeting between Trump and newly elected French President Emmanuel Macron in which the two men appeared locked in a hand-wrestling match as a visual metaphor of the U.S. president\u2019s European trip.\nWATCH:  Trump Meets French President Macron\nVideo size\nwidth\nx\nheight\npixels\nTrump Meets French President Macron\nShare this video\n0:00:26\n\u25b6\n0:00:00\n/0:00:26\n\u25b6\n\u25b6\nDirect link\n270p | 1.4MB\n360p | 2.3MB\n480p | 12.1MB\n\u201cThe Frenchman grabbed Trump's hand and squeezed hard,\u201d the magazine noted. \u201cTrump squeezed back.

But the latest remarks by British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson could signal a possible major shift in policy by one of Washington's closest partners.\nNeither British Prime Minister Theresa May nor U.S. President Donald Trump mentioned Syria during their joint news conference at the White House Friday. Johnson did not accompany the British government chief on her visit to the U.S., but he discussed the situation in Syria with members of Parliament in London.\nTime to re-evaluate\nJohnson said the transition of power in Washington since Trump's inauguration should prompt all sides involved in the Syrian conflict to re-evaluate their positions. Taking note of the U.S. president's planned telephone discussion on Saturday with Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin, Johnson admitted that taking a new approach toward Syria would have potential drawbacks.\nBut speaking to the international relations committee of the House of Lords, the upper house of Parliament, Johnson said there is now a need to be \u201crealistic about the way the landscape has changed\u201d and seek a fresh approach to the Syrian crisis.\n\u201cIt is our view that Bashar al-Assad should go. It's been our long-standing position,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cBut we are open-minded about how that happens and the timescale on which that happens.\u201d\nSyria's President Bashar al-Assad speaks to French journalists in Damascus, Syria, Jan. 9, 2017.\nMeeting with Bannon\nJohnson discussed foreign policy and other issues earlier this month with senior members of Trump's team, including chief strategist Steve Bannon, in New York. Long known as a gadfly within Britain's Conservative Party, and for his outspoken, irreverent views, Johnson was a journalist and served as mayor of London until 2016, when his strong support for Brexit, Britain's breakaway from the European Union, catapulted him into the job of serving as his country's top diplomatic post in May's Cabinet.\nRussia has sought to impose its influence as a power broker in the Syrian civil war, and Trump has repeated his desire to have a good relationship with Russia.\nRussia question dodged\nA White House adviser said Trump and Putin may discuss lifting U.S. sanctions imposed on Russia after its annexation of Crimea and support for secessionist groups in Ukraine. Speaking at his news conference with Britain's May, Trump did not answer directly when asked if he planned to ease any of the financial measures targeting Russian businesses.\nIf there is an agreement to end the civil war in Syria, Johnson said in London Thursday, Assad should be allowed to run for president in elections overseen by the United Nations. Russia and Iran have made similar proposals, saying Assad should be free to seek re-election during a future political transition period.\nThe 51-year-old Syrian government leader, trained as an ophthalmologist, has ruled his country since 2000, after the death of his father, Hafez al-Assad, who had tightly controlled Syria for three decades.\n\n            ",

Seven years is the maximum prison term the court could issue. \nChoi Chang-young, chief judge of the case, said the disaster could have been prevented if Shin and others in the company, a subsidiary of British consumer goods company Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc, had tried to ensure the chemicals\u2019 safety. \nRetailers found guilty, too \nFormer and current officials at Oxy\u2019s research and development department were also sentenced to prison terms of between five and seven years. However, the judge acquitted John Lee, Google Korea\u2019s CEO, who was chief at Oxy Reckitt Benckiser from 2005 to 2010, citing a lack of evidence proving he knew about the products\u2019 risks while in charge. \nExecutives at Lotte Mart, Homeplus and other retailers were also found guilty and sentenced to prison terms of three to five years for selling the toxic product without assuring its safety. \nThe consumer product disaster affected many households in South Korea, where infants and pregnant women often battle dry winter seasons with humidifiers, and the rulings could set a precedent for punishing businesses that put profit ahead of safety. \nHazard undiscovered for years \nThe fatal disinfectant was first sold by Oxy in 2001 and later by other companies seeking to tap demand from hygiene-conscious consumers. The hazards of breathing in the disinfectants were discovered in 2011, when authorities investigated mysterious lung diseases that were killing pregnant women and concluded the disinfectants were to blame.\nThe government halted sales and urged victims to come forward to report their cases. After prosecutors launched investigations, Reckitt Benckiser, whose products caused the most injuries and deaths, apologized last year and promised to compensate them.\nA family member of a victim of toxic humidifier disinfectants weeps during a press conference against the court's sentence in Seoul, South Korea, Jan. 6, 2017. Family members and victims wanted harsher sentences.\nMore than 5,000 cases believed to be related to the disinfectant products had been reported to the government as of December, including about a thousand deaths. The government is still reviewing cases.\nA group of victims said Friday they were unhappy with the ruling because prosecutors had sought harsher sentences for those implicated in the case. Prosecutors had urged that Shin be sentenced to 20 years in prison. \n\n            ",

Rebel forces have been fighting to oust him since December 2013, amid accusations that Kiir has concentrated power in the hands of his own Dinka tribe.\nKiir used a national day of prayer last Friday to order the release of General Elia Waya Nyipoch and Major General Andria Dominic, both detained since last May. Onek said he considered the gesture a good first step.\nThe two generals were set free Tuesday, according to government officials.\nDire conditions for detainees\nIn May 2016, Amnesty International released a report detailing what it described as \u201cappalling\u201d conditions for South Sudanese political detainees. The report said most of the detainees were never charged with an offense, but were being held in dire conditions and fed only once or twice a day.\nFILE - South Sudan's President Salva Kiir, left, accompanied by army chief of staff Paul Malong, right, waves during an independence day ceremony in the capital Juba, South Sudan, July 9, 2015.

He said during the five months he was imprisoned, he had no idea why he was there.\nBut now, he said he\u2019s ready to move on.\n\u201cWe do not want to dwell in the past, we want to go forward,\u201d he said.

His posts have included the Soviet mission to the United Nations; Russia's Permanent Representative to NATO; Russian ambassador to Belgium; and Deputy Minster of Foreign Affairs.\nHe has been Russian ambassador to the U.S. since 2008 and can frequently be seen casually strolling around Washington.\nMichael McFaul, who was U.S. ambassador to Russia from 2012 to 2014, calls Kislyak \"a very successful ambassador who is \"underrated\" in Washington.\n\u201cI am impressed by him,\" McFaul told a forum at George Washington University on Friday. \"When I was in the government, sometimes he would drive me nuts because he was so active in developing relationships with individuals across our government. \u201c\nObservers describe Kislyak as friendly and say he likes to open the Russian Embassy for dinners and teas for journalists and Washington officials.\nKislyak once lamented that while Russia and the U.S. \"were able to to end the Cold War ... we weren't able to build post-Cold War peace.\"\nHe is also known for forcefully defending his government's positions. For example, he has denounced the mass demonstrations that ousted Ukraine\u2019s Russia-backed president, Viktor Yanukovych, in 2014 as the \u201cunconstitutional forceful overthrow\u201d of an elected government.\nLike other Russian officials, Kislyak has also blamed Kyiv for the fighting between government forces and Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine, which has killed more than 9,750 people.\n\u201cWhat is portrayed as a Russian aggression in reality is a war of the government of Ukraine against their own people. So I would advise our friends not to misrepresent what is happening on the ground: government forces killing Ukrainian citizens.

They had said they would drop out, as the extra distance would mean more harassment.\n\"A principal has been appointed, and admissions will start for the 2017-18 session on Thursday itself for the new classes,\" Haryana education minister Ram Bilas Sharma told reporters.\nTelevision images showed the girls, in blue and white uniforms, slumped in the laps of their mothers and other students before they ended their fast. Some were hospitalized after they fainted.\nWhile literacy levels in India have steadily climbed as enrollment surged, the dropout rate remains high.\nAbout 18 percent of students dropped out before grade 10, according to official data. A survey by nonprofit Save the Children found the dropout rate for girls is as high as 70 percent.\nThat has led to an uneven national literacy rate of 65 percent for women compared to 82 percent for men.\nReasons for dropping out range from poverty to lack of facilities such as toilets, which affect adolescent girls more, said Soha Moitra, a director at nonprofit Child Relief and You (CRY) in Delhi.\nTo address these problems, officials passed the 2009 Right to Education Act promoting free, compulsory education for children up to age 14, and have introduced efforts to build more toilets under a national cleanliness campaign.\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi has stressed the importance of educating girls with the \"Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao\" (save your daughter, educate your daughter) campaign.\nBut the issue of unsafe commutes is unresolved, Moitra said.\n\"Especially in villages and small towns, students may have to walk through open fields and lonely neighborhoods,\" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n\"Adolescent girls are particularly vulnerable because of the lack of safe public transport.\"\nA 2014 poll by the Thomson Reuters Foundation ranked India the fourth most dangerous place for a woman to take public transport.\nWith a patriarchal society and cultural preference for sons, Haryana has among the lowest sex ratios with 879 females per 1,000 males, compared to the national average of 943.\nThe state also has a high incidence of violence against women.\nEarlier this week, Haryana police said a 23-year-old woman was gang-raped and murdered by men who smashed her skull with bricks.\n\"The issue is no longer if girls want to study. It's an issue of safety. If we cannot guarantee that, how can we blame them for dropping out of school?\" Moitra said.\n\n            ",

Riyadh appeared to disengage from Lebanon over the past year as it became increasingly occupied with struggles against Iran in Syria, Yemen, Iraq and Bahrain.\nIn each case, the two rivals back opposing sides.\nIn February, Riyadh cancelled a $3 billion aid package for the Lebanese army and also advised big-spending Saudis not to visit Lebanon, which relies heavily on tourism.\nThis coincided with a financial crisis at the Saudi Oger construction firm belonging to the Hariri family, Saudi Arabia's main ally in Lebanon.\nTensions also cast a shadow on the fate of an estimated 750,000 Lebanese nationals living and working in Saudi Arabia and in other Gulf Arab states, who transfer between $7 and $8 billion each year to support extensive families.\nTies began to thaw after Aoun was elected in October in a deal that also saw Lebanon's leading Sunni Muslim politician, Saad al-Hariri, appointed prime minister.\nIn a statement on Monday, Hariri said Aoun's Riyadh visit was an important step to \"normalize Lebanon's relations with Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states.\"\nWhile visiting Beirut in November, Saudi Prince Khaled al-Faisal, the governor of Mecca and also a nephew of King Salman bin Abdulaziz, invited Aoun to visit his country.\nThe Lebanese Presidency said in a statement that eight ministers would accompany Aoun on his visit, due to last until Wednesday.

But the atmosphere may not turn out to be as warm as the Florida weather.\nTrump telegraphed on Twitter his prognosis for his first encounter with China's president, saying it will be a \u201cvery difficult\u201d discussion, since the U.S. can \u201cno longer have massive trade deficits and job losses.\u201d \nAt a White House meeting last week, Trump told U.S.-based manufacturers they will find it \u201cinteresting\u201d to watch his meeting with Xi.\n\u201cI look very much forward to meeting him and the delegation. And we'll see what happens,\u201d Trump said. \nThe Chinese leader likely won't arrive empty-handed.\n\u201cI foresee that the Chinese will send Xi here with a pretty large and generous gift package, in terms of domestic infrastructure investment here in the United States, and help President Trump to create jobs that he had promised to the voters,\u201d Stimson Center Senior Associate Yun Sun told VOA.\nChinese President Xi Jinping, right, attends a meeting with Serbian President Tomislav Nikolic at the Great Hall of the People, March 30, 2017 in Beijing, China.\n'Something crazy could happen ...' \nSome China watchers caution that not everything may go according to script, as this early in the Trump administration much is still unwritten. \n\u201cSomething crazy could happen unexpected, certainly. You know one tweet could change the trajectory of the meeting to some extent,\u201d says Scott Kennedy, deputy director of China studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). \u201cBut I expect it's going to be a lot of complaining without a lot of negotiation, specifically, and then the Chinese will leave nervous, anxious. And eventually the other shoe will drop.\u201d\nThere is a significant chance \u201cTrump makes a comment which Xi could read as a shift in U.S. policy,\u201d predicts Cato Institute policy analyst Eric Gomez. \u201cHowever, given Trump's struggle with facts I suspect that Xi will also place greater value on U.S. actions rather than words.\u201d\nGomez tells VOA considering the new administration's demonstration that \u201cits word is not always its bond, Xi would be foolish to take every statement at face value.\u201d\nThere is also a perception, both in Washington and Beijing, of an ideological split in the Trump White House between a nationalistic-driven, anti-China faction and a more pragmatic group, especially in terms of trade policy.\nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer addresses reporters during the daily briefing at the White House in Washington, April 3, 2017.\nMeeting a test for Trump\nSome analysts see Xi's primary goal during the visit is to get a sense of the man in the White House with whom he'll be presumably negotiating for years to come.\n\u201cThis is really to test Donald Trump's mettle,\u201d says Harry Kazianis, who directs defense studies at The Center for the National Interest.\nWhite House Press Secretary Sean Spicer has noted several \u201cbig problems\u201d between the United States and China.\n\u201cEverything from the South China Sea to trade to North Korea. There are big issues of national and economic security that need to get addressed,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cAnd I think there's going to be a lot on the table when it comes to that over the two days that they will talk.\u201d\nThe president, before getting to the White House last year, talked tough about China. He vowed punitive trade measures. But there has been no such action, so far.\n\u201cThe 45 percent tariff on Chinese exports to the United States \u2014 that has not happened. The currency-manipulator label that he promised has not happened,\u201d notes Yun.\nIn this Dec. 2, 2016 photo released by Taiwan Presidential Office, Dec. 3, 2016, Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen speaks with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump through a speaker phone in Taipei, Taiwan.\nOne China policy\nChina's ambassador to the United States, Cui Tiankai, sent White House senior adviser, Jared Kushner, who is the president's son-in-law, drafts of a joint statement the two countries could issue at the conclusion of the summit, according to The New York Times.\nClose attention will be paid to any final wording on the One China policy \u2014 a highly volatile issue for Beijing, which considers Taiwan a renegade province.\nThe United States switched it diplomatic ties from Taipei to Beijing in 1979. But the policy was recently thrown into disarray when Trump accepted a congratulatory phone call from Taiwan's president.\nXi reportedly would not get on the phone with Trump until the U.S. president reaffirmed the policy.\nTrump's America-first agenda and desire to reduce Washington's global leadership comes as China is extending its reach around the world, noted the South China Morning Post, the leading English-language daily in Hong Kong, in an article headlined \u201cTrump vs Xi: prepare for a clash of views on big global issues.\u201d\nWatch related video report\nVideo size\nwidth\nx\nheight\npixels\nTrump Sees 'Interesting,' 'Difficult' Talks With China's Xi\nShare this video\n0:02:23\n\u25b6\n0:00:00\n/0:02:23\n\u25b6\n\u25b6\nDirect link\n270p | 6.9MB\n360p | 10.1MB\n720p | 61.7MB\n1080p | 44.9MB\nSome Trump stances favor China\nThe Trump administration is actually viewed as taking some stances helpful to China's goals, such as withdrawing the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact and, so far, it has not authorized any \u201cfreedom of navigation\u201d exercises in the disputed South China Sea waters and airspace Beijing claims as its own. It has kept in place, however, some Obama administration polices Beijing does not like, such as reaffirming Washington's defense treaty with Tokyo that covers the Senkaku islands, held by Japan and claimed by China.\nOn the navigation patrols by the U.S. military, which China deems provocative, \u201cI wouldn't be surprised if the new administration would look to take more robust measures than the Obama administration,\u201d says Andrew Small, senior Transatlantic fellow with the Asia program at the German Marshall Fund of the United States.\nBut on territorial issues during the meeting in Florida this week, Small on VOA's Encounters program, predicted \u201cthere won't be a consensus reached on this.\u201d\n'Trade is the wild card'\nIt is a region, however, where the United States retains tremendous leverage due to its vast alliance relationships \u201cthat have withstood the test of time,\u201d compared to China only being able to point to North Korea as a significant ally, said Kazianis on the same VOA program.\nBut America's reputation in the Asia-Pacific region has been somewhat tarnished with the Trump Administration's rejection of the TPP.\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid China is the winner out of this new trade policy,\u201d laments Small.\n\u201cTrade is the wild card. If the administration takes the very hardline positions that Trump promised during the campaign, then America's China policy would be much more confrontational than it was under the Obama administration,\u201d says Gomez at the Cato Institute.\nThe senior advisor on China at CSIS, Christopher Johnson, expresses concern that top Chinese government officials regard the U.S. president akin to an Asian businessman or a potentate, \u201cwith whom they can sort of have a very transactional relationship.\u201d \nThat \u201ccaricature-like assessment\u201d could lead to disappointment for Xi, cautions Johnson, who expects President Trump to stand firm when it comes to his belief on the trade imbalance.\nKazianis agrees, predicting that when it comes to trade \u201cPresident Trump in private is going to take a very hard line.\u201d\n\n            ",

They are demanding the government implement an agreement it signed in 2013 to raise salaries and improve working conditions. However, the strike is taking a deadly toll on the nation's poor.\nJared Ochieng lost his son Lamarck to complications from leukemia.\n\"If it were not for the strike, I would have not lost my son,\" Ochieng said.\nLamarck was diagnosed with leukemia a year ago. When he started experiencing complications in early February, the family took him to the nearest hospital, Kenyatta National Hospital, one of approximately 2,500 public health institutions affected by the nationwide strike.\nFILE - Doctors are seen operating on a cancer patient at a Nairobi hospital.

Ombuor/VOA)\n\"When I got there, the doctor who was concerned with the disease that my son was suffering from was nowhere to be found because of the strike,\" Ochieng said. \"I lost my son when he was in Kenyatta, when they were making arrangements to take the boy to Texas [Cancer Facility].\"\nThe center is a private facility in Nairobi, but the high cost makes it an option of last resort for many Kenyans. Some cancer patients have had to suspend treatment until public doctors return to work.\nThe Kenya Cancer Association says it is getting reports of three deaths a week \u2014 a 50 percent increase compared to this time last year, says program director Moses Osani.\n\"The doctors' strike has significantly affected the cancer patients in that most of them have had interrupted treatment,\" Osani said. \"For example, if someone had to go for a cycle of eight weeks and at the sixth week, doctors went on strike, then their treatment was interrupted, which means they probably had to seek treatment elsewhere.\"\nThe strike has also affected emergency medical services.\nJudy Nabwani says her son was hit by a speeding vehicle. Twelve hours later, she traced him to a country referral hospital where only basic first aid had been administered.\n\"He could not move or talk,\" Nabwani said. \"He was just lying there.\"\nShe said that a nurse told her the doctors were on strike and that the best thing to do was to refer him to a private hospital. He died before he could be moved. Nabwani said her son would not have died if he had been attended to on time.\nHis cause of death was internal bleeding due to brain injury.\nFILE - A riot policeman stands guard as doctors chant slogans after their case to demand fulfilment of a 2013 agreement between their union and the government that would raise their pay and improve working conditions in Kenya, Feb. 13, 2017.\nThe striking doctors have refused to resume work, even after union leaders were arrested. The government has said it does not have the funds to implement the collective bargaining agreement it signed in 2013.\nKenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Union spokesperson Dr. Davis Ombui told VOA the union is pushing for much-needed improvements to the health system.\n\"So far, we actually empathize with the situation,\" Ombui said. \"We know many Kenyans are losing their lives. Even us as doctors, we have relatives, we have friends, we have family and it has affected us all. But the narrative we are sticking to is that we cannot go back and supervise deaths as it were.\"\nIn addition to raising salaries, the 2013 deal called for the government to hire nearly 5,000 doctors over a four-year period and equip hospitals with the necessary machines and drugs.\nHopes are high that negotiations underway will end the strike, but for families of the deceased, it is too late.\n\n            ",

Tillerson pointed to a lack of trust between the two countries.\nOn Thursday, Trump adopted a more optimistic tone, saying on his Twitter account, \"Things will work out fine between the U.S.A. and Russia. At the right time everyone will come to their senses & there will be lasting peace!\"\nPutin told an interviewer on Russian state television on Wednesday that relations between the two countries have deteriorated this year since Trump took office three months ago.\nThe immediate point of contention between Moscow and Washington is how an April 4 chemical weapons attack that killed more than 85 people and sickened hundreds in Syria occurred. Tillerson said the United States is \"quite confident\" that it \"was planned and it was directed and executed by Syrian regime forces.\" But Lavrov gave no ground on the Russian claim that the sarin gas assault was either a provocation by Syrian rebels or was triggered when Syrian warplanes struck a rebel munitions depot holding sarin gas.\nCall for 'thorough, honest' investigation\n\"We have insisted that we have a very thorough investigation,\" Lavrov said at a news conference with Tillerson. \"We want an honest investigation.\"\nRussia's top diplomat said Moscow will not \"shield anyone\" responsible for the attack.\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov listens to U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, right back to the camera, during their talks in Moscow, Russia, April 12, 2017.\nTrump, in an interview, said Putin was partly to blame for the Syrian conflict, now in its seventh year, for backing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, whom he called an \"animal.\"\nTillerson's trip to Moscow represented the highest-level contact between the United States and Russia since Trump took office in January. The two countries are at odds over multiple issues, including Moscow's continued support for rebels in eastern Ukraine battling against the Kyiv government, and the U.S. intelligence community's declaration that computer hackers, acting on orders from the Kremlin, interfered in last year's U.S. presidential election.\nTillerson said Wednesday Russian meddling in the U.S. election was a serious problem that has been \"fairly well established.\"\nLavrov protested that Russia is the victim of \"very slanderous attacks,\" and added, \"I have to say once again ... no one has shown us a single fact. Give us the evidence of Russia's illicit involvement in U.S. politics,\" Lavrov said, \"and we will respond.\"\n'Potential' for improved relations\nThe U.S. cruise missile attack on a Syrian airbase last week escalated tensions in the Syrian conflict, Lavrov said. He added, however, that he believes Moscow and Washington have \"great potential\" to improve their relationship.\nThis satellite image released by the U.S. Department of Defense shows a damage assessment image of Shayrat air base in Syria, following U.S. Tomahawk missile strikes, April 7, 2017.\nTillerson said, \"We need to attempt to put an end to this steady degradation which is doing nothing to restore the trust between our two countries or to make progress on the issues of the greatest importance to both of us.\"\nThe U.S. envoy said the two countries \"have agreed to establish a working group to address smaller issues and make progress towards stabilizing the relationship. So that we can then address the more serious problems. Foreign Minister Lavrov and I agreed we would consider further proposals made about the way forward in Syria, including consulting with our allies and coalition members and we will continue discussions about how to find a solution to the Syrian conflict.\u201d\nAlexander Vershbow, former U.S. ambassador to Russia, professed a guarded optimism \u2014 with a caveat.\n\"I think it's a good thing that the Russians and the U.S. have agreed to re-establish the deconfliction line, because it's in no one's interest to have an incident in the skies over Syria that could make a very difficult relationship even more difficult,\" he told VOA during an interview at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. \"That being said, I'm not sure there's all that much meeting of the minds on what needs to happen to bring about an end to the war in Syria.\"\nFILE - NATO Deputy Secretary-General Alexander Vershbow speaks during a media conference in Vilnius, Lithuania, March 24, 2016.\nRegardless of U.S.-Russian ties, Vershbow, a former deputy secretary-general to NATO, said the April 4 chemical weapons attack precludes any political future for Assad.\n\"The problem of Assad is still very fundamental. It's not a question of 'we don't like him in the international community,' it's that the Syrian people, after all the destruction he has committed against them \u2014 and then even using chemical weapons despite supposedly giving them up \u2014 it's just inconceivable that he could be accepted as part of a solution by the people of Syria. So, Russia used to say they're not wedded to Bashar al-Assad, but it looks like they've gotten remarried again. And that's going to be a difficult issue going forward,\" he said.\n\"The situation is more difficult today, bilaterally, than it was three, three-and-a-half years ago, and the stakes are higher,\" Andrew Kuchins, a Eurasian affairs expert with the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, told VOA's Russian Service, referring to Syria's largest chemical weapons attack of August 21, 2013. \"But I think that sort of structural dynamic [of U.S.-Russian diplomatic ties], and therefore the possibility of a way out, is still there.\"\nPutin: 'Where's proof against Syria?'\nPutin discussed the general decline in U.S.-Russian relations with the state television channel Mir before his meeting with Tillerson.\n\"It can be said that the level of trust at the working level, especially at the military level, has not become better, but most likely has degraded,\" Putin said. \"Where is the proof that Syrian troops used chemical weapons? There isn't any. But there was a violation of international law. That is an obvious fact.\"\nTrump had praised Putin as a strong leader during his long campaign for the White House, but on Wednesday he highlighted the Russian president's role in the Syrian civil war. \"Frankly, Putin is backing a person that's truly an evil person,\" Trump said, referring to Assad. \"I think it's very bad for Russia.

He was sentenced to three years imprisonment in December 2015.\nFILE - Ildar Dadin is shown participating in a rally in support of a detained anti-government activists at Manezhnaya Square in Moscow, Russia, April 6, 2014.\nIn the fall of 2016, Dadin said through his wife that he was tortured and beaten in the prison where he was serving his sentence, located in the northwestern Russian region of Karelia. That provoked a strong reaction in Russia and abroad. His case attracted great public attention and the activist was transferred to a prison colony in eastern Russia.\nIn early February, the Russian Constitutional Court ordered that the country's Supreme Court should review Dadin's case, but upheld the provision mandating the prosecution of repeated violations of the procedure for holding rallies. Later in the month, the Supreme Court overturned Dadin's conviction and ordered his release from prison.\nDadin was released on February 26, having served a year and two months in prison.\nIn an interview with VOA\u2019s Russian service, Ildar Dadin discussed torture in Russian prisons, street protests, human rights protection and the need for penalties for human rights violations.\nQuestion: How you have changed, having been jailed for exercising your rights?\nAnswer: The certainty of my belief in what I was doing has only strengthened. This is as it should be. Plus, there is the knowledge that a very terrible evil is taking place in our prisons and colonies that I previously did not know about. This further gave me confidence that I was doing the right thing, because this shouldn't happen.\nQ:How would you describe the work that you are now doing?\nA: I am fighting for goodness and justice. In particular, for laws and human rights here to be not only on paper but also implemented in reality. Because the law says that torture is prohibited, but in practice it is widely practiced in jails and prisons. On paper, we have it written that citizens have inalienable constitutional rights, but in fact it turns out that officials who view themselves as rulers and us as slaves trample on all our constitutional rights. They repress people who advocate that the government uphold constitutional rights.\nQ: What was the main thing that struck you in prison? What was the most depressing thing?\nA: The saddest thing for me is that these sadists who beat and torture people have devised a great many ways, a whole range of humiliations, to crush human dignity, to break a person. And also, the fact that these people are trying pass off these actions as being legal. They pass off as law pure mafia methods of pressuring a person, of breaking them by any means, outright banditry and evil. \u2026 These people are evil posing as good, and therefore are super evil. I am sure that this is primarily being done to subordinate people, to turn prisoners into slaves, and to rob those slaves.\nQ: How can the use of torture in the Russian prison system be changed?\nA: For starters, I think you need to achieve the principle of the inevitability of punishment, inevitability of accountability. For example, I now want to do everything possible so that people from the colony where I served time, who hold official posts and have used their official powers to commit crimes, are jailed, not only because they tortured me (while I was there, I heard them torturing, beating and mocking people), but because\u2026 the principle of the inevitability of accountability should be applied to other criminals, to other heads of colonies in other regions of Russia\u2026 In my opinion, as long as criminals who hide behind their uniforms and commit crimes are not jailed, it will be a direct example that they can continue to do this. My wife sent a letter from one of those incarcerated in IK-7 (the colony where Dadin served time). In January, the authorities there approached this convict and threatened: \"As soon as everything calms down we will cut your legs off.\u201d\nQ: How do you assess the prospect of street protests in Russia? How successful can they be?\nA: I do not know the exact answer to that question. Logic and experience suggest to me that nothing can happen generally without street protests, because there absolutely has to be pressure from below, from ordinary citizens. As smart and good as the human rights defenders may be, under the constitution, the power is with the people. It is precisely the demands of the people that need to be seen -- their statements that they are confirming the human rights defenders are telling the truth, that they agree with the demands of the human rights defenders. I think this is essential. Human rights defenders must be supported by the citizens on the streets. I now plan to engage in more human rights advocacy \u2013 to write complaints to government agencies that should uphold the rule of law, must prosecute criminals. But it seems to me that we should never move away from street activity. Ordinary citizens always have to validate these demands by human rights defenders.\nQ: Do you think that the system decided to punish you as example to others?\nA: I am 100 percent sure of this. Because they did not need to punish me personally, but above all wanted to show my example to others, so that they do not dare to participate in street protests. When I was still under house arrest, some of the boldest of my fellow human rights defenders came to me and told about how they had to set out for protests with an eye on this article (of the Russian Criminal code introducing criminal responsibility for \"repeated violations of the procedure for holding rallies\u201d) and count how many of them had been detained before. And in the course of the proceedings in the so-called Constitutional Court, in an explanatory note to the law that introduced this article of the Criminal Code, it was written that we need a repressive measure, because it is a \"stop measure\" to stop the protests, because people still continue to come out. The word \"repression\", \"repressive\" is definitely there; they they do not even conceal it.\nThis report was produced in collaboration with VOA's Russian Service.\n\n            ",

The country is looking for new trading partners around the world, but the government will find it difficult to balance voters\u2019 demands for lower immigration with the need for new free trade deals.\nThe British government says its vision is of a more global Britain, trading freely with growing economies like India and China once it is outside the European Union.\nForeign Secretary Boris Johnson visited several Indian cities last week, eager to build bridges before Britain drops out of the European Union.\n\u201cWe may be leaving the EU, we may be we may be taking back control of our borders. But my Indian friends, I say to you, that does not mean we want to haul up the drawbridge,\u201d he said.\nBut critics say Britain is doing just that even as it asks India to open trade talks.\nTightening of visa system\nEducation is a major British product. But numbers of Indian students in Britain are falling fast, halving in just five years. India blames Britain\u2019s tightening visa system.\nBritish Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson speaks during the International University Students' Parliament debate at Presidency University in Kolkata, India, Jan. 19, 2017.\nPratik Dattani is British director for the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry.\n\u201cIt is not all one way traffic, that the UK can sell internationally and not bring anything in,\" said Dattani. \"There has to be an open policy in terms of allowing immigration.\u201d\nThat could be a tough sell to Britons who voted to leave the EU hoping it would cut immigration.\nBritain is hoping for flexibility. At the World Economic Forum in Davos last week, Indian ministers voiced willingness to discuss a deal. But no formal talks can take place until after Britain has left the European Union. Even then, a deal would likely take years to reach agreement, says Dattani.\n\u201cIndia and the EU have been negotiating a free trade agreement for seven or eight years. And many of the areas that have meant it has taken such a long time have been asks from the UK itself,\u201d said Dattani.\nSeeking new trade deals\nBritain says it will look to the Commonwealth for new trade deals when it leaves the European Union. A Commonwealth heads of government meeting is due to take place later this year in London.\n\"That is an opportunity really for the British government to show the rest of the Commonwealth, of which India is a massive part, that Britain is open for business,\" he said.\nDespite the big ambitions, analysts say Britain will find it difficult to strike quick trade deals after it leaves the European Union. That has raised fears in London that businesses could face a so-called cliff edge the day Britain leaves the bloc.\n\n            ",

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has denied he or his wife, Akie, had any influence over the land deal. Abe, however, said he was aware that Akie served in an honorary position for the school whose president is a passionate supporter of the prime minister's views. \nThe same school operator runs a kindergarten with a curriculum said to resemble that of pre-World War II Japan. It plans a similar approach for the new elementary school, which is set to open in April, pending final approval by Osaka prefecture.\nThe scandal has dominated parliamentary debate, with opposition lawmakers summoning finance and education ministry officials to clarify how the school obtained the large discount.\nOpposition Liberal Party lawmaker Masato Imai told reporters that the land deal must be scrutinized further because it's the taxpayers' money. \u201cAs honorary principal, Mrs. Akie Abe has served as a billboard for the school with various problems. We believe she bears a responsibility at least indirectly, if not directly.\u201d\nNobutaka Sagawa, an official at the Finance Ministry, which oversees state land transactions, told parliament this week that industrial waste had been found on the land after the initial appraisal and the deduction involved the cleanup cost. He denied any illegality or political influence in the process. Officials said the waste removal was not compulsory, and they could not confirm whether the school had actually done it.\nAkie Abe agreed to become honorary principal of the elementary school, \u201cMizuho no Kuni\u201d (The Land of Rice),\u201d after her visit a few years ago to the kindergarten run by Yasunori Kagoike.\nTelevision footage from her September 2015 visit shows, she told the kindergartners' parents, \u201cMy husband also thinks that education policy here is excellent.\u201d\nIn a message posted on the school website, she wrote that she was deeply impressed with Kagoike's \u201cpassion for education\u201d and that the school's moral education fosters Japanese pride and strong principles among children. The message and her photo, which were on the website on Wednesday, were no longer there on Thursday. Phone calls to the school were not answered.\nThe school and Kagoike have also drawn attention over a note distributed to parents of the kindergartners that criticized Koreans and Chinese, prompting Osaka prefectural officials to question the school, which later apologized. Similar statement was also posted on the kindergarten website. \n\u201cI haven't done anything wrong,\u201d Kagoike told TBS radio interview on Monday. \u201cI think evil political power and non-conservative media are trying to crush our plans for a school that respects history and tradition, and is conservative.\u201d\n\n            ",

As Iraqi forces pushed in, the 17-year-old and his family ran. He held a small cousin while IS militants fired at them from behind.\nTwo weeks later, IS bullets still whiz down the street near where the teenager's body lay slumped against a wall amid personal effects of other civilians shot down.

He holds them in the air and shouts: \u201cDamnation on Daesh!\u201d\nInside IS territory, the Arabic acronym \u201cDaesh\u201d is forbidden, but where Iraq is in control, only the pejorative term for the jihadist group is used.\nContinued fire\nHazzam Abdulghani's brothers, two other uncles of the dead 17-year-old, duck their heads and race across the street as IS continues to fire.\n\u201cThese were his prayer beads,\u201d Abdulghani said. \u201cWe need to call an ambulance to take him away.\u201d\nHazzam Abdulghani holds up prayer beads he finds on the body, cursing IS and saying he knows now it is his nephew in Mosul, Iraq, June 15, 2017.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been 13 or 14 days,\u201d the other uncles say, seeming more shocked at the state of their nephew's body than his death. They had tried to search this spot since he went missing, but it was an active war zone closed off by the military until now.\n\u201cWe are dying in so many ways,\u201d Abdulghani said. \u201cWe are dying by airstrikes, mortars and sniper fire. We are dying because we have no food or clean water.\u201d\n\u201cI have a friend in the Old City whose two babies starved to death,\u201d adds his brother. The three men nod.

More than 230 civilians have been killed by IS sniper fire in recent weeks, and hundreds of others from airstrikes, according to the U.N.\nCivilians who have fled IS in Mosul say the death tolls are far higher.\nIraqi soldiers say the Old City is surrounded, but the frontlines are fluid as IS continues to fight to expand, taken in Mosul, Iraq, June 15, 2017.\nAnd the coming battle could prove to be the most difficult fight Iraqi and coalition forces have faced to date, adds Ahmed Ghalibi, a soldier with the Emergency Response Division, an Iraqi front-line fighting force.\n\u201cThey will fight like someone who will die,\u201d he said, leaning on his truck under a bridge, where civilian families gather to be transported out of the war zone after they flee. \u201cThey have lots of guns that they haven\u2019t used yet.\u201d\nThe remaining IS militants in the Old City, he explains, are their best fighters, holed up with their families and bent on killing as many people as possible before they die.\nThe Old City is all but completely surrounded, Ghalibi added, but front lines are fluid, as IS occasionally advances into areas it once fled.\nNew, or rarely used tactics may become more commonplace as militants become more desperate, he said. They expect homes, and sometimes refugees, to be wired with bombs, more homemade chemical weapon attacks, and militants forcing families to help them try to escape.\n\u201cWhen ISIS started, they were attackers,\u201d Ghalibi said. \u201cNow they are defenders.

Some children have even witnessed the death of loved ones,\" said Giovanna Barberis, UNICEF's Ukraine representative.\nFILE - A local resident holds his children in a basement which is being used as a shelter following shelling in Donetsk, eastern Ukraine.\nBarberis has frequently traveled to the contact line and seen the hardships and suffering of the children, who live in a state of constant fear and uncertainty. The trauma has taken a huge emotional and psychological toll, according to Barberis.\n\"Parents, teachers, school directors and psychologists describe striking behavior changes among children as young as 3 years old,\" she said. \"Children are very anxious. They wet their beds. They have nightmares. In some cases, they act quite aggressively and often withdraw from their families and friends.\"\nBarberis said some children no longer seek safety in bomb shelters because they think such attacks are \"normal now.\"\n\"Families and children are getting used to living in a very abnormal and exceptional situation,\" she said. \"But this does not mean that they cope well with the situation.\"\nEscalating hostilities\nThere have been multiple violations of the Minsk peace agreement since it was signed in September 2014 by representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the Donetsk and Luhansk people's republics.\nIn its latest report on the situation in Ukraine, the U.N. Human Rights Mission found that a sharp escalation of hostilities between January 29 and February 3 had \"a devastating impact\" on all aspects of life for civilians living along the contact line. It said seven civilians were killed and 46 wounded in those six days.\nIn addition, \"Several hundreds of people are isolated and deprived of basic necessities,\" according to the report.

Ukrainian officials, however, warn it is at risk of falling apart.\nUnder the cease-fire announced in Munich by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, both sides are supposed to abide by the two-year-old Minsk agreement and withdraw heavy weaponry from the front lines.\nYet, just hours before the foreign ministers of Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany announced this latest truce, a separatist leader was issuing military threats.\nAlexander Hug, chief of a monitoring mission for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, says there has been a significant reduction in armed incidents, noting that only small-arms fire was heard in the Donetsk region after the truce took effect at midnight, local time.\nBut Hug warned Monday that conditions for a flare-up were present as \u201cheavy weapons remain on both sides of the contact area where they shouldn't be.\u201d\nFILE - Tanks are seen in the government-held industrial town of Avdiyivka, Ukraine, Feb. 2, 2017.\nUnlikely to hold \nAnalysts say the cease-fire is unlikely to hold, given that the underlying causes for the conflict remain unaddressed. Ukrainian officials are also skeptical, saying this truce will likely follow the pattern of the previous four cease-fires -- an immediate, but short-lived, reduction in violence, followed by an increase in clashes.\nThe previous cease-fires in a conflict that has left nearly 10,000 dead lasted for little more than a day.\nLate Sunday, before the cease-fire went into effect, the warring sides traded mortar fire around the government-held town of Avdiyivka on the outskirts of Donetsk.\nOn Friday, Oleksandr Zakharchenko, leader of the Moscow-backed separatists in Donetsk Oblast, announced he was not bound by any deal involving the withdrawal of heavy weapons from the front. He also claimed the Ukrainian military will try to seize settlements in the buffer zone under the guise of the truce.\nA key condition in the 2014 and 2015 Minsk agreements, which were mediated by Moscow and European governments, is that neither side should retain heavy weapons in the \u201ccontact area.\u201d As reaffirmed in the cease-fire deal, both sides are to withdraw artillery systems with calibers of 100mm or more 50 kilometers from the contact line. Grad multiple rocket launchers may be no closer than 70 kilometers, while larger missile systems have to be at least 140 kilometers from the front.\nA Ukrainian soldier shows pieces of shrapnel in a crater left by an explosion in Avdiivka, Ukraine, Jan. 31, 2017.\nRussian maneuvers \nOvershadowing the cease-fire are growing concerns in Ukraine that Moscow is maneuvering to pressure or persuade the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump to accept a trade-off for peace in east Ukraine. The New York Times reported Sunday that Trump\u2019s personal lawyer and a former business associate met with a pro-Moscow Ukrainian lawmaker last month in New York to discuss a peace plan that involves the de facto recognition of Russia's annexation of Crimea.\nKremlin officials maintain they had no knowledge of the meeting and called the peace plan absurd. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to talk about,\u201d President Vladimir Putin\u2019s spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.\nBut Ukrainian officials told VOA they fear Moscow's maneuvers and worry some Trump advisers are eager to use Ukraine as a bargaining chip in a bigger strategic play to reset U.S.-Russian relations.\nAsked about the meeting, Ukraine's ambassador to Britain, Natalia Galibarenko, told the BBC: \u201cWe are not trading our territories. We are not going to say, \u2018Let us abandon Crimea and in return, let us see peace in Donbas'.\u201d\n\"Donbas\" refers to the part of southeastern Ukraine that encompasses the country's Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts.\nUnited States Vice President Mike Pence, left, and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko meet for bilateral talks during the Munich Security Conference in Munich, Germany, Feb. 18, 2017.\nUS support \nOver the weekend, before the New York Times story was published, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko attended a security conference in Munich, where he met with U.S. Vice President Mike Pence.

The Ukrainians claim the order effectively means Moscow has broken the Minsk agreement.\nBut the Kremlin argues the order only temporarily recognizes the separatist-issued documents and is in response to humanitarian need.

It is located on the ground and second floors of a high-rise building.\n\"Originally, when we started, we weren't sure where we were going,\" said Lee Ielpi, whose firefighter son, Jonathan, died in the attacks. \"We realized, as the years went on, that we are making an impact.\"\nArtifacts on display at the museum include \"missing persons\" posters that were hung throughout the city in the immediate aftermath of the attacks, when families still held hope that their loved ones would be found alive.

He said the institutions \"complement each other,\" with the Tribute Museum able to truly personalize the experience of the day through the volunteer guides.\nThe new space cost $8.7 million.

America first!\" At the time, he probably had no idea he was touching off a viral video sensation that would inspire people in countries around the world to mock not only him, but their own countries.\nA talk show host in the Netherlands started it. Comedian Arjen Lubach aired a video on his talk show extolling the virtues of the Netherlands in a bid for runner-up. It is narrated in English by Dutch-American actor Greg Shapiro, who imitates Trump's voice.\n\"We speak Dutch,\" the video says. \"It's the best language in Europe. We've got all the best words. All the other languages failed.\" The video also calls the Spanish \"total scumbags,\" describes a dike designed to protect the sea-level nation from flooding as \"a great, great wall,\" and labels its banking system \"the best tax-evasion system in the world.\"\nThe video's tagline: \"We totally understand it's going to be America first. But can we just say the Netherlands second? Is that OK?\"\nSoon, German talk-show host Jan Boehmermann produced a similar video and challenged talk-show hosts in other countries to do the same. The German video called the Dutch \"bad people\" and touts the German tradition of Oktoberfest as \"the best beer festival God ever created.\"\nAt Boehmermann's instigation, the trend became an organized contest called \"Every Second Counts\" and grew to include more than two dozen entrants.

Saturday Night Live has seen its ratings soar during the presidential campaign as well as after the election.\nRising ratings\nIn the United States, political satire has been growing in popularity since the Trump administration took office, with the live comedy-sketch program Saturday Night Live enjoying its most-viewed season in 22 years. On the show, popular comedians have mocked President Trump, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, among others.\nTalk show host Stephen Colbert, whose The Late Show with Stephen Colbert specializes in political satire, has enjoyed five straight weeks of ratings success over his competitor Jimmy Fallon, who hosts the long-running Tonight Show.\nFallon has been criticized for being too easy on Trump, while Colbert has skewered the president and his administration, recently mocking Trump's use of the word \"bloodbath\" to quip that the new Republican health care plan \"does not cover bloodbaths.\"\nThat the United States' polarizing new leader has inspired a surge of satire is not surprising to Sophia McClennen.\n\"Satirical mockery, political comedy, and 'laughtivism' are some of the most powerful weapons in our anti-Trump arsenal,\" wrote the professor of international affairs at Pennsylvania State University, in Salon last month. She said satire always emerges in times of political crisis because it helps expose untruths and combat a culture of fear.\nFILE - Late Show host Stephen Colbert records a skit on the floor of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio, July 17, 2016. Colbert is known to use his show to regularly roast President Donald Trump and members of his administration.\nGetting to know the players\nKatie Hayes, editor of the student newspaper The Montage at St. Louis Community College in Missouri, wrote on February 22 that satire not only provides a pressure-release valve, it also helps to educate.\n\"People pay attention when you make them laugh,\" Hayes said. \"Since Saturday Night Live has begun impersonating key players in our government, Americans are able to identify them.\"\nA good example is Steve Bannon, the controversial right-wing figure who serves as the president's chief strategist. He has been portrayed on SNL as the skeletal figure of Death, silently peering over the president's shoulder in the Oval Office.\nKellyanne Conway, a presidential aide who was recently photographed kneeling on a couch in the Oval Office, was skewered on SNL by comedian Kate McKinnon kneeling on a couch on the sidelines of various skits.\nComedy also allows for the expression of dissent.\nChristopher Irving, a humanities instructor at Beacon College in Leesburg, Florida, said the primary reason for the surge in comic portrayals of current U.S. politics \"might stem from the simple desire to be involved in the discussion about how well or how poorly [President Trump] is doing the job. The alternating current produced by a joke carries much farther than a bitingly critical observation, regardless of the medium.\"\nComedy for change?\nComic performers in Washington, D.C., are certainly having a satiric field day this year.\nJoe Kaplan of political revue group Hexagon, says a Conway sketch may figure in this year's annual show, with an actress explaining Trump's actions through a popular 1960s doo-wop song. The show opened Friday and promises plenty of jokes about the president, Congress and current events.\nFILE - Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon is seen during a recording of one of his shows in New York City, Sept. 16, 2017. Fallon, too, has taken on politicians but is seen as softer compared to some of his competitors.\n\"The best comedy is found in truth,\" Kaplan says. \"One of the songs I wrote is called It Doesn't Matter.... The whole premise of the song is how facts don't matter anymore in Trump's world.... I made the last line poignant, rather than funny, because these are serious times we're living in. You have to make some light of it to get by.\"\nAn ongoing question: Do these jokes have any power to effect change in the current political climate?\nMary Dalton, professor of communication, film studies, and women's, gender, and sexuality studies at Wake Forest University, is co-editor of the book The Sitcom Reader: America Viewed and Skewed.\n\"Satire is not just making fun of something, it's a way of pointing out what's wrong with a desire to lead to change as a correction,\" she said. She acknowledges that comedy is not the most direct method to effect change, but says, \"If you lay the foundation for something, if you drive the message home often enough, sometimes things click into place.\"\nStress relief\nKen Rynne is a Washington, D.C., comic who runs a small satire outfit called Planet Washington. He writes and performs his own musical comedy shows. He calls the Trump administration \"the new abnormal.\"\nRynne is vocal on social media about his opposition to many policies and people associated with the Trump administration. But at the end of the day, he says, his decision to leave a higher-paying job to skewer people in the political world - a transition he calls \"my rags from riches story\" - boils down to the most immediate results: stress relief, and fun.\n\"There's nothing that beats making people laugh,\" he said. Whatever the political leanings of his audience, Rynne says, \"you should leave the show lighter than you came.\"\n\n            ",

But after an election that magnified the country\u2019s deep differences of opinion, the Super Bowl matchup offers easy foils for anyone inclined to play politics. \nTrump\u2019s friendship with Brady has been fodder for sports talk radio and local news in New England since September 2015, when one of Trump\u2019s trademark red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats was spotted in Brady\u2019s locker and the quarterback said it would be great if the GOP hopeful in a crowded primary field won it all. \nMost of Atlanta is represented by longtime Democratic U.S. Rep. John Lewis, who has been excoriated by Trump because he boycotted the inauguration and doesn\u2019t consider Trump a legitimate president because of intelligence reports of Russian involvement in the election. Trump won Georgia in November with more than 2 million votes. \n\u201cIt\u2019s been very tough,\u201d said Segun Idowu, a Boston civil rights activist who grew up in Massachusetts, went to college in Atlanta, voted for Clinton and will likely be rooting for the Patriots. \u201cThe Trump versus Lewis metaphor seems apt to me.\u201d\nPatrick Dugan, a Clinton voter from West Hartford, Connecticut, said his Patriots fanhood has become \u201cincreasingly lukewarm\u201d because of the team\u2019s Trump connections. \n\u201cYou can\u2019t put that genie back in the bottle,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s out there at this point. And once it\u2019s out there, it colors how you look at them, whether you want it to or not.\u201d\nTrump campaign \nTrump drew attention to his relationships with the Patriots several times throughout his campaign and leading up to his inauguration, including an election eve rally where he read a glowing letter from Belichick and claimed Brady voted for him, prompting a denial from the quarterback\u2019s supermodel wife, Gisele Bundchen. \nBrady, for his part, hasn\u2019t revealed his vote and questioned this week why his long friendship with Trump is \u201csuch a big deal\u201d after being asked whether he called the Republican to congratulate him, as Trump claimed in a speech attended by Kraft the night before his inauguration.\n\u201cIf you know someone, it doesn\u2019t mean that you agree with everything they say or do,\u201d Brady said. \nIndeed, few recent marriages of sports and politics have caused this much hand-wringing. There was relatively little furor when basketball megastar LeBron James, fresh off winning a title for the Cleveland Cavaliers, endorsed and stumped for Clinton in his home state of Ohio, which Trump won anyway; or when now-ousted Bills coach Rex Ryan introduced Trump at a campaign rally in Buffalo last year. \nAs president, Trump drew on his sports connections when he tapped New York Jets owner Woody Johnson as the next U.S. ambassador to Britain. And Peyton Manning, the retired Denver Broncos quarterback who won the Super Bowl last year, joined Trump and other leaders in Philadelphia Thursday night as Republican lawmakers gathered to map out their congressional agenda. \nConversations on Twitter, Facebook and other social networks show the Patriots have certainly won over some new fans because of the Trump ties. \nAnd many in Patriots Nation are certainly dreaming of sweet revenge if NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has to hand the championship trophy to Brady. Goodell suspended Brady for four games at the start of this season for using underinflated footballs in a playoff game, a case that wound through two federal courts and spurred lots of disdain for Goodell among Patriots fans.\n\u201cI want the Falcons to win for normal sports fan reasons, but I want the Patriots to lose in embarrassing fashion for political reasons,\u2019\u2019 said Todd Moye, who grew up in Atlanta and now lives in Fort Worth, Texas. \nAs the Super Bowl approaches, some skeptical New Englanders say they\u2019ve made their peace with politics and, for now, are just focused on the game.\n\u201cI have family members who support Trump. I\u2019m not going to write them off, either,\u201d said Clinton voter Jack Peterson of Fairhaven, Massachusetts. \u201cYou just try to compartmentalize.\u201d\n\n            ",

But it came to light, after Sessions had taken office as the country's top law enforcement official, that he had met twice last year with Moscow's ambassador to Washington.\nSince then, Sessions says that he had met with Sergey Kislyak in his capacity as member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, not as part of Trump's presidential campaign.\nFILE - President Donald Trump walks with former President Barack Obama on Capitol Hill in Washington.\nUnproven wiretapping allegation \nTrump sparked more controversy with his claim that his predecessor, Obama, had wiretapped him in the weeks before the election.\nThe publisher of the Newsmax Media website, Christopher Ruddy, a friend of Trump's, wrote Sunday the president told him, \"This will be investigated. It will all come out. I will be proven right.\"\nRuddy said he has never seen Trump as angry as he was over the handling of the Sessions matter and then complaints from both opposition Democrats and Republican colleagues of Trump that his wiretap claim was unfounded.\nTrump has denied any links to Russia, but several of his aides have met with Kislyak.\nTrump ousted his first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, after just 24 days on the job after he lied to Vice President Mike Pence and other top officials about the nature of his conversations with Kislyak.\n\n            ",

Qalibaf's dropping out may serve to get him more votes in his challenge to Rouhani.\nThe election is largely viewed as a referendum on the 2015 nuclear deal struck with world powers shepherded by Rouhani's administration. That deal saw Iran limit its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of some economic sanctions.\nRouhani remains the favorite as every Iranian president since 1981, when Khamenei himself took the presidency, has won re-election.\nHowever, most Iranians have yet to see the benefits of the nuclear deal. Raisi has been campaigning on that, proposing populist cash payments for the poor that have proven popular in the country in the past under Ahmadinejad.\n\n            ",

It will be informed by what I picked up here by our allies for our military commanders in the field,\" Mattis said.\nMattis told reporters that the international coalition in Afghanistan \"may have pulled our troops out too rapidly.\"\nFormer President Barack Obama cut American military support in the country from about 100,000 U.S. troops in May 2011 to fewer than 10,000 American troops over four years.\n\"Mattis and Trump are just repairing a mistake, in effect, that I think President Barack Obama made. And it is, in a sense, more properly carrying out Obama's own strategy than Obama himself did,\" Michael O'Hanlon, a senior defense analyst at the Brookings Institution, told VOA.\nO'Hanlon added that by restoring just a few thousand more international troops, the coalition could get enough advisers into the field with some of the key Afghan units to \"hopefully really stabilize the situation.\"\n\n            ",

But their connections to the Christian-funded school and North Korea\u2019s precedent of charging missionaries with \u201chostile acts\u201d suggest the pretext of illicit religious activities may be used to justify their arrests.\nConstant surveillance\nA spokesman for the university said the arrests of the two faculty members were \u201cnot connected in any way with the work of PUST.\u201d\nThe school, founded in 2010 by Korean-American evangelical Christian James Kim educates the children of the North Korean elite. There are 500 undergraduate students and 60 graduate students.\nKorean-American writer Suki Kim taught English at PUST in 2014 and later documented her experience in the book, Without You, There Is No Us: Undercover Among the Sons of North Korea\u2019s Elite. \nDuring a 2015 Google Talk seminar, she described how the faculty was always under surveillance, their classes recorded, movements restricted, and how her government counterpart minder would casually refer to topics she included in personal emails.\n\u201cSo I would say (in an email) for example I woke up today at 4 a.m., or whatever, and then the minder would repeat that to me. He would say, \u2018Did you get up at 4 a.m. this morning? You must be tired,\u2019\u201d Suki Kim said.\nVulnerable situation\nAlthough the school adheres to the government prohibition on proselytizing, it also attracts many evangelical Christians to become volunteer faculty members that receive no income for teaching. Kim Hak Song, who was arrested this week, had been doing missionary work in China before joining PUST.\nSuki Kim recently wrote in the Washington Post that while PUST complies with the restrictions on overt religious activities, their long-term mission is to convert North Koreans, \u201cthrough seemingly unconditional kindness, with the hopes of those beneficiaries eventually turning to the religion out of gratitude.\u201d\nShe also wrote that the American evangelicals on the PUST faculty are in a particularly vulnerable situation if the Kim Jong Un government wants to send a political warning to the United States, and that, \u201cthe timing of North Korea\u2019s arrest of Tony Kim is no accident.\u201d\nTensions between North Korea and the United States have risen over Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear and ballistic missile tests. U.S. President Donald Trump has been pressuring China to increase sanctions on Pyongyang to halt its nuclear program and has emphasized the United States would consider the use of military force to respond to future tests.\nNorth Korea in the past had detained Americans to gain outside concessions for their release, which sometime involved high-profile U.S. missions sent to secure the release of detainees.\nFILE - In this combination of file photos, U.S. citizens Otto Warmbier on March 16, 2016, left, and Kim Dong Chul on April 29, 2016; are escorted at court in Pyongyang, North Korea.\nSanctions\nPUST spends roughly $2 million annually on operating expenses, the school said in a statement. Much of it comes from Korean churches in the United States and South Korea. The education is free, and the curriculum includes electronic and computer engineering, international finance, and agriculture and life sciences.\nSupporters say this type of assistance and engagement will change hearts and minds over time, and foster constructive future relationships between the next generation of North Korean leaders and the outside world.\nHowever critics like Joshua Stanton, a Washington-based attorney and author of the One Free Korea blog, has accused the school of providing vital technical training to future North Korean hackers and has called for PUST to be suspended in accordance with United Nations sanctions prohibiting activities that may contribute to the \u201cproliferation sensitive nuclear activities or ballistic missile-related programs.\u201d\n\u201cOne could hardly invent a better demonstration of how \u2018engagement\u2019 has failed to change Pyongyang than a hostage crisis at PUST,\u201d he recently wrote in his blog.\nKorean-American Kim Dong Chul is also serving 10 years on espionage charges and Otto Warmbier, a University of Virginia student, was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor in 2016 for removing a propaganda poster from a hotel.\nYoumi Kim in Seoul contributed to this report.\n\n            ",

He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010, the year after he was convicted and jailed by a Chinese court.\nCalls for his release\nIn the years since, China has ignored international calls to free Liu while isolating him to the degree that he\u2019s been unable to convey any message to the outside world. His wife, Liu Xia, has been under strict house arrest in Beijing despite never being accused of any crime. Even after he was transferred to the hospital in the northeastern city of Shenyang under a medical parole, Liu, his wife and family members were largely prevented from communicating with the outside.\nIn her statement, Zeng repeated the call that Liu should be freed and allowed to seek treatment overseas. Before then, Liu\u2019s doctors should be able to speak freely about his medical treatment, and Liu should be transferred to a top international hospital in China, she wrote. \nAlthough the Chinese government has so far showed no sign that it would free Liu or allow him to travel overseas, it has acceded to family requests to allow liver cancer experts from Germany, the U.S. and elsewhere to join the Chinese medical team treating Liu. \nApart from the hospital\u2019s statements, China has released little information about Liu\u2019s situation, and supporters who have visited the Shenyang hospital have been unable to locate him. \nChina has rejected outside calls for his release as interference in its domestic affairs, and it\u2019s unclear if any foreign experts had yet arrived in Shenyang. \n\n            ",

U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson had temporarily prohibited the government from enforcing the order in a March 15 decision.\nBoth orders apply nationwide.\nWatson wrote that the circumstances that led to his initial decision have not changed, including Hawaii's argument that remarks by Trump and his associates have singled out Muslims.\nThe judge said the state has sufficiently established a likelihood it would succeed in challenging the ban on the grounds it violates a constitutional clause that requires government actions to have a primarily secular purpose.\nThe government appeal was filed in the ninth circuit court of appeals Thursday. The ninth circuit has already played a role in the travel ban saga, upholding a temporary stay placed on the earlier executive order limiting travel signed by the president.\nNoor, 8 (C) sits with her sister Maryam, 18, and their mother Nadia Hanan Madalo, 46 (R) as they wait in an airport bus in Irbil, Iraq, March 15, 2017.

It includes barring the issuance of new visas to people from Iran, Syria, Libya, Yemen, Somalia and Sudan for 90 days, and suspending the refugee program for 120 days. During those periods, reviews of vetting procedures and how to strengthen the screenings are supposed to take place.\nWatson said the government has argued the courts should ignore the context surrounding the order. \"The court will not crawl into a corner, pull the shutters closed, and pretend it has not seen what it has,\" he wrote.\nThe government argued that any injunction should apply only to the visa ban and not affect suspending refugee admissions, but the judge said \"it makes little sense to do so.\"\nPresident vows to fight back\nTrump has vowed to continue fighting legal challenges to his order, taking them up to the Supreme Court if necessary.\nHawaii's Department of the Attorney General expressed confidence that higher courts will continue to side with its position. \"We believe the court's well-reasoned decision will be affirmed,\" it said on Twitter.\n/*<![CDATA[*/\ninitInfographics(\n{\ngroups:[],\nparams:[{\"Name\":\"embed_html\",\"Value\":\"\\u0026lt;blockquote class=\\\"twitter-tweet\\\" data-lang=\\\"en\\\"\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;p dir=\\\"ltr\\\" lang=\\\"en\\\"\\u0026gt;\\\"While we understand that the President may appeal, we believe the court\u2019s well-reasoned decision will be affirmed.\u201d (4/4)\\u0026lt;/p\\u0026gt;\u2014 Hawaii AG (@AtghIgov) \\u0026lt;a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/AtghIgov/status/847291792940609536\\\"\\u0026gt;March 30, 2017\\u0026lt;/a\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/blockquote\\u0026gt;\",\"DefaultValue\":\"\",\"HtmlEncode\":false,\"Type\":\"HTML\"}],\nisMobile:true\n});\n(function (d) {\nvar userInput = Infographics.Param[\"embed_html\"],\nthisSnippet = (d.getElementsByClassName ? d.getElementsByClassName(\"twitterSnippet\") : d.querySelectorAll(\".twitterSnippet\"))[0],\nrender = function () {\nvar eval, bquote, sId = \"twitterAPIForSnippet\";\ntry {\neval = document.createElement(\"div\");\neval.innerHTML = userInput;\n} catch (e) {\nthisSnippet.innerHTML = \"Twitter Embed Code is invalid or incomplete.\";\nreturn;\n}\nbquote = eval.childNodes[0];\nif (bquote.tagName.toLowerCase() === \"blockquote\" && bquote.className.indexOf(\"twitter\") !== -1) { //remove everything except paragraphs and links\nvar all = bquote.getElementsByTagName(\"*\");\nfor (var i = all.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {\nvar elm = all[i];\nvar tag = elm.tagName.toLowerCase();\nif (tag !== \"a\" && tag !== \"p\")\nall[i].parentNode.removeChild(all[i]);\n}\n} else {\nthisSnippet.innerHTML = \"Twitter Embed Code does not contain proper Twitter blockquote.\";\nreturn;\n}\nif (!window.twttr && !d.getElementById(sId)) { //async request Twitter API\nvar js, firstJs = d.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0];\njs = d.createElement(\"script\");\njs.id = sId;\njs.src = \"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";\nfirstJs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, firstJs);\n}\nthisSnippet.parentNode.style.width = \"100%\";\nthisSnippet.appendChild(bquote);\nvar renderTweets = function () {\nif (window.twttr && window.twttr.widgets) {\nwindow.twttr.widgets.load();\nwindow.twttr.events.bind(\"rendered\", function (e) {\n//fix twitter bug rendering multiple embeds per tweet.

It shows, too, that IS will follow through on its threats to terrorize Iran, which it sees as a battlefield enemy and religious persecutor.\nIS has long accused Shiite-led Iran of executing thousands of the Sunni minority in the country.\nIraq's Iran-backed Shiite paramilitary force has inflicted hundreds of casualties on IS and driven IS from land outside Mosul. In Syria, Iran has been a major military backer of the Syrian regime, first in its war with rebel groups across the country and later against IS.\nFILE - A Shiite fighter clashes with members of the Free Syrian Army rebel group in the town of Hatita, in the countryside of Damascus, Syria.\nCombat troops in Syria\nAbout 10,000 Iranian combat troops are in Syria fighting alongside thousands of fighters from Hezbollah, Lebanon's Tehran-affiliated Shiite militia, and assorted Shiite militias made up of renegade Pakistanis, central Asians and other nationalities.\n\"With its direct involvement in fighting IS in Iraq and Syria, a retaliation from IS shouldn't be a surprise to authorities in Iran,\" said Alex Vatanka, a senior analyst at the Washington-based Middle East Institute.\nIran intelligence has boasted about layers of security applied by agents protecting the country from IS infiltrations. Several times in recent months, Iranian officials have spoken about breaking up IS-related terror cells and arresting IS-affiliated militants planning attacks inside Iran.\n\"We have built a complicated network of security nets from Karbala all the way to Tehran that allows us to trace every single move of Daesh [IS],\" Hojatoleslam Toyserkani, representative of Iran's supreme leader to the Basij paramilitary forces, said last week.\nUntil Wednesday, the alleged security veneer seemed intact even though officials' claims of the public's protection from IS lacked many details, including when alleged incidents took place, the identity of most suspects, and concrete links to IS. \n\"Iranian authorities were good in preventing IS from conducting operations inside Iran, but this attack put a crack on the bubble of invincibility Tehran tried hard to project,\" analyst Vatanka said.\nWednesday's twin synchronized attacks on two of the most visible and secure sites in the capital were intended by IS to put Tehran on notice, analysts said.\nMembers of Iranian forces are seen during an attack on the Iranian parliament in central Tehran, Iran, June 7, 2017.\nVideo of attack\nIS-affiliated Amaq social media released a video allegedly showing the attacker storming a parliament office, shooting at staff and shouting IS slogans in Arabic.\n\"IS wants to send a message that despite all security measures, they can conduct attacks and tarnish Iran's intelligence reputation,\" Karim Pourhamzavi, an extremism analyst at Macquarie University in Sydney, told VOA.\nIn March, IS issued a video threatening Iran and promising to conquer the country soon. The 36-minute Persian-language clip was narrated and hosted by several Persian speakers with heavy Baloch accents.\nThe speakers allege that more than 18,000 Iranian Sunnis have been executed since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. One of the speakers urges Sunnis to join the group \"to defend their dignity and regain the pride taken away by Iranian Shia authorities.\"\nBut several opinion polls have shown little Sunni interest in joining IS.\nStill, Wednesday's attack had people in Tehran wondering if IS has more support than Iran leaders let on. It marks the first time the Sunni Muslim group admitted it staged an attack in the majority Shiite Muslim country.\n\"The timing of the attack and good knowledge about the entrances of parliament are hints that may make us think that they had insiders or having access to some precise information before conducting the attack,\" said Mohammad Ghorbani, a Tehran-based reporter who covers terrorism issues.\nFILE - Smoke raises behind an Islamic State flag in Iraq, Nov. 24, 2014.\nPresence likely to grow\nStill, in the long run, some analysts think it's doubtful IS will forge a deeper presence in Iran.\n\"IS have always conducted attacks inside countries using local agents and supporters,\" Emad Abshenasan, a Tehran-based extremism analyst, told VOA. \"IS has no base in Iran, and even its minority Sunni population do not favor or support IS or its ideology.\"\nBut by getting more involved in conflicts in Yemen, Syria and Iraq, Tehran is exposing itself more to possible terror at home, analysts said.\n\"As Tehran deepens its engrossment in regional conflicts and into affairs of the Arab world, it makes itself more susceptible to these kinds of attacks partially, directly, or indirectly supported or directed by its contenders in the region,\" analyst Vatanka said.\n\n            ",

It\u2019s not clear what statements the revisions would cover.\nBut experts in Taipei believe neither that change nor any other move is likely to rattle Taiwan before the Communist Party\u2019s year-end congress, which could decide changes in the senior Chinese leadership as well new mandates on relations with other governments.\nChinese President Xi Jinping (center) listens during the opening session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in Beijing's Great Hall of the People, March 3, 2017. The head of China's legislative advisory body, Yu Zhengsheng, said China continues its firm opposition to Taiwan's formal independence and insistence that its leaders accept that the self-governing island is part of China.\nChance to break deadlock\n\u201c(Chinese President) Xi Jinping himself or the party center does not want Taiwan to become a hot potato before the 19th party\u2019s congress,\u201d said Alexander Huang, strategic studies professor at Tamkang University in Taiwan. \u201cThey would not do anything dramatic if there is no specific issue to be dealt with.\u201d\nTaiwan has indicated it might make an overture to China within the year.\n\u201cThe second half of the year might be a good chance to break the deadlock in cross-Strait relations,\u201d Chiu Chui-cheng, deputy minister with Taiwan\u2019s Mainland Affairs Council, said Thursday without elaborating.\n\u201cThe Council thinks that a lot of international and regional changes since the start of the year are affecting development of the cross-Strait situation,\u201d Chiu said. \u201cTo handle international, regional, cross-Strait and domestic uncertainty, the government must stay calm, rational, and control risks and seize opportunities while cautiously promoting cross-Strait policies.\u201d\nEconomic, diplomatic pressure\nIn the meantime, China could use more economic and diplomatic pressure to push Taiwan toward a resumption of dialogue that stopped after Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen took office in May. Tsai\u2019s party includes advocates of Taiwan\u2019s de jure independence from China to consecrate self-rule. Independence is a red line for Beijing, but surveys indicate most Taiwanese prefer autonomy.\nThat type of pressure will probably mean more cuts in Taiwan-bound group tourism, which fell 30 percent from May through December. China would also continue to bar Taiwan from United Nations events and from joining sub-agencies such as the International Civil Aviation Organization.\nBut it could also reverse any of those moves, said Huang Kwei-bo, associate diplomacy professor at National Chengchi University in Taipei.\n\u201cTo make Taiwan poor, that\u2019s one thing, and another is in international space to make it less convenient for Taiwan,\u201d he said. \u201cThe result I think is that just Beijing wants to remind Taiwan people if cross-Strait relations are not good, this is what you\u2019re going to see. Basically whatever mainland China does, they will be able to reverse any of it.\u201d\nFavors likely\nAnalysts in Taiwan also expect China will offer favors to Taiwanese investors who back Beijing\u2019s views on relations. It will also push for more people-to-people exchanges, especially among youth, Huang Kwei-bo said.\nAccording to convention, delegates at the year-end congress in Beijing would give Xi another five-year term as party chairman, auguring political stability for China as a whole and in turn for its relations with Taiwan.\n\u201cAs a rule, when authority in Beijing is strong and steady, Beijing\u2019s measures toward Taiwan are more flexible,\u201d said Lin Chong-pin, a retired strategic studies professor in Taiwan. Measures are \u201charsh\u201d when authorities are being challenged, he said.\nTsai\u2019s government and officials in Beijing have never talked because they cannot agree on how to regard each other \u2014 as two parts of China per Beijing\u2019s view or against a backdrop that recognizes Taiwan\u2019s self-rule. Chinese leaders talked regularly with the eight-year government of Tsai\u2019s predecessor, Ma Ying-jeou. Ma\u2019s government and China signed more than 20 deals that stimulated trade and investment between the two sides.\nChina and Taiwan have been separately ruled since the Chinese civil war of the 1940s, when Chiang Kai-shek\u2019s Nationalist lost to the Communists and re-based in Taipei.\n\n            ",

Organizers said 78,000 demonstrators participated, while police estimated the crowds at 50,000.\nThe big gathering came after aggressive riots overnight in the city's Schanzenviertel neighborhood, which is only a few hundred meters from the summit grounds. Hundreds of special riot police went into buildings to arrest rioters wearing black masks, while being attacked with iron rods and Molotov cocktails. About 500 people looted a supermarket in the neighborhood, as well as smaller stores. Cars were torched and street fires lit as activists built barricades with garbage cans and bikes.\nA man looks through the broken window of a shop in Hamburg, Germany, July 8, 2017. Anti-globalization activists rioted for a second night as Hamburg hosted the Group of 20 leaders.\n'Not the slightest justification'\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed shock and anger about \"violence and uninhibited brutality\" that broke out in Hamburg.\n\"There is not the slightest justification for looting, arson and brutal attacks on the life of police officers,\" Merkel said, adding that the security forces did \"excellent work\" and thanking them on behalf of all the summit participants.\nA few thousand rioters, some of them from elsewhere in Europe, created havoc in the city. They battled riot police for two consecutive days and nights, expressing rage against capitalism and globalization and calling for open borders to let all refugees enter Europe.\nTheir anger was not so much focused against President Donald Trump or other leaders, but directed against police as symbols of authority.\nPolice arrested 143 people, and 122 activists were temporarily detained. Injuries to 213 officers have been reported since protests started Thursday night. Police and firefighters said they did not have information about how many protesters and other civilians had been hurt.\nHamburg, Germany's second-largest city, has a strong radical left scene, and many critics had warned well before the summit that its dense streets would be almost impossible to control and that clashes would be likely.\nBut German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said, \"Any criticism of the location of the meeting misjudges cause and effect.\"\nProtesters block a road during the G-20 summit in Hamburg, Germany, July 8, 2017.\n\"These were unbounded violent excesses out of a desire for destruction and brutality,\" de Maiziere said. He added that police and judicial authorities must take a tough stance against such crimes and that the arrests were appropriate.\nSite choice defended\nMerkel also defended the choice of Hamburg as venue for the summit, saying a big city was needed to accommodate all the participants at hotels. She said she and her finance minister would consult with Hamburg's city government about how to help people affected by the violence repair the damage.\nMany residents showed frustration with the violence and destruction unleashed in their neighborhood.\nLaura Zeriadtke watched the full-scale clashes unfold from her street-level apartment window and witnessed about 30 black-clad anarchists tearing down a construction fence across from her home and using it as a shield to push back riot police.\n\"It was a civil war,\" Zeriadtke said.\nWomen hold up megaphones during a protest against the G-20 summit in Hamburg, Germany, July 8, 2017.\nLudwig Geiss, a 65-year-old longtime resident living in the same building as Zeriadtke, said that he'd gotten used to the many protests in the alternative neighborhood, but had never experienced anything like the G-20 chaos.\n\"I know the scene, but what happened yesterday ... puts it all in the shadows,\" Geiss said as he was evaluating the damage outside his apartment. \"I'm not staying here another night.\"\nPolice called on witnesses of the riots to upload photos and video footage on their server to help with the investigation and prosecution of violent activists.\nHowever, most protesters expressed their views peacefully, asking for quick action on climate change and solutions to the migration crisis.\nDuring the protest marches on Saturday afternoon, activists of the Attac group rolled a giant globe along the road, while others carried signs with slogans such as \"Money for bread, not bombs\" and \"We are many, you are 20.\"\n\n            ",

We\u2019re very angry at what he\u2019s done.\u201d\nIn the last year, North Korea conducted two nuclear tests, a satellite launch using banned intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) technology, and fired numerous short and midrange missiles from submarines and mobile land based launchers.\nBefore taking office in January Trump sent out a tweet saying, \u201cIt won\u2019t happen!\u201d in response to the North Korean leader\u2019s public message saying his country is prepared to conduct an ICBM test.

They\u2019re going to solve the problem for us.\u2019 That\u2019s the wrong way to understand what\u2019s going on,\u201d said John Delury, an associate professor of Chinese studies at Yonsei University in Seoul.\nThe Obama administration\u2019s policy of strategic patience, which relied on increasing sanctions and diplomatic isolation, failed to pressure Pyongyang to suspend its nuclear program. \nCritics say the policy failed, in large measure, because Beijing will not enforce harsh measures that might result in instability at its border, the collapse of the Kim government, and the increased power and influence of the United States and South Korea in the region.\nBreaking the cycle\nThis stalemate has accelerated a cycle of North Korean provocations in defiance of United Nations resolutions banning the country\u2019s nuclear and missile programs, followed by international condemnation and further sanctions that so far have had only limited impact.\nPyongyang\u2019s relentless efforts to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of delivering a nuclear warhead to the U.S. mainland add new urgency to devise a strategy against this threat to U.S. security.\nAnalysts say there are no good military options to take out the North\u2019s nuclear and missile facilities without triggering a deadly counter attack on allies South Korea and Japan, and even possibly starting a full scale war.\nThus, engaging North Korea is the only realistic way to reach a peaceful resolution. But that would require the Trump administration to take the initiative.\n\u201cIf the U.S. does not move, Pyongyang will not move, and the stalemate will continue and a stalemate could become more risky and dangerous,\u201d Moon said.\nThe dealmaker\nChina\u2019s ban on North Korean coal along with informal talks that are being organized between former U.S. officials and North Korean representatives could offer Trump an opportunity to open a new channel of dialogue.\nTrump, who sees himself as a dealmaker and who has been critical of his predecessors, could be willing to break with the past and try a more unconventional approach.\n\u201cDonald Trump is uniquely positioned to move on that and he is strangely immune to criticisms that would stop a Democrat or a Republican dead in their tracks,\u201d Delury said.\nAny deal to get even a temporary nuclear freeze from Pyongyang will require real concessions that could include the suspension of U.S.-South Korean joint military exercises and later more incentives like a formal peace treaty and other security guarantees and economic assistance to reach the ultimate outcome of a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.\nThe political winds in South Korea also seem to be changing with liberal pro-engagement forces gaining popular support in the wake of conservative President Park Geun-hye\u2019s impeachment amid a corruption scandal. If the country\u2019s Constitutional Court rules in favor of the impeachment, a new presidential election will follow soon.\nOf course negotiations would require time and intense coordination, and could be undone by North Korean provocations and violations, as has happened with past agreements, but advocates say it may be time to try again.\nUnder a 2005 \u201csix party\u201d joint agreement with South Korea, the United States, China, Russia and Japan, North Korea agreed to dismantle its nuclear weapons program in exchange for economic aid, security guarantees and improved diplomatic ties.\nBut Pyongyang failed to live up to its commitment and conducted its first nuclear test in 2006.\nYoumi Kim contributed to this report.\n\n            ",

Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) says potential opium production was up 43 percent, reaching 4,800 tons in 2016.\n\u201cIn fact, the value of opiates produced in that country is equivalent to a considerable portion of the country's economy in 2016 - some 16 percent of the GDP - and was worth more than two-thirds of the entire agricultural sector of the country,\u201d the UNODC noted in the report.\nThe illicit economy is fueling insecurity, violence and insurgency among other problems to discourage private and public investment in Afghanistan, the UNODC reiterated.\n\u201cThe cultivation provided labor for an estimated 235,100 full-time jobs in 2016, and the sales of opium poppy and derivatives constituted the main source of income of opium poppy farmers, accounting for up to 57 percent of the annual household income,\u201d according to the UNODC.\nAfghanistan remains the world\u2019s largest opium producer and exporter, despite a U.S. investment of $8.5 billion to help counter the illicit narcotics economy, which produces an estimated 80 percent of the world\u2019s heroin, says an American government agency.\n\u201cThe narcotics industry, coupled with rampant corruption and fraud, is a major source of illicit revenue,\u201d the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, or SIGAR, noted in its latest quarterly report.\nFILE - Afghan boy walks through a poppy field to harvest opium, the main ingredient in heroin, in the Khogyani district of Jalalabad, east of Kabul, Afghanistan.\nThe narcotics trade also undermines governance and rule of law throughout Afghanistan, SIGAR said.\nU.S. anti-drugs authorities say that a \"symbiotic relationship\" exists between the Taliban-led insurgency and traffickers.\nThe traffickers, they note, provide weapons, funding and material support to the insurgency in exchange for protection, while insurgent leaders traffic drugs to finance their operations.\nThe commander of the U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan, General John Nicholson, said last December the opium trade provides about 60 percent of the funding for the Taliban insurgency.\n\n            ",

Shi'ite fighters mostly are paid in cash from Iran, the Syrian government and coffers of the Lebanese-based, pro-Iranian Hezbollah, according to analysts.\nIran would foot the bill alone in the future, a Syrian official told VOA on the condition of anonymity, confirming the Al Wasel report.\n\u201cThe number of Shia militia has increased dramatically during the last two months,\u201d the official said. \u201cWhile a big part of these militia were recruited by Iran, a relatively big part was recruited by the Syrian government directly. We are speaking about more than 50,000 militants from different nationalities. The Syrian government requested that Iran provide for all of the mentioned militias.\u201d\nThe document from Al Wasel put the number of fighters to be paid at 88,733 \u2014 a figure analysts say is exaggerated. They estimate that about 10,000 Iranian combat troops are in Syria fighting alongside thousands of fighters from Lebanon's Tehran-affiliated Shiite militia Hezbollah and assorted Shiite militia made up of renegade Pakistanis, central Asians and other nationalities. Since January 2013, more than 1,000 members of Iran\u2019s elite Quds Force or other elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) units have been killed fighting in Syria.\nTehran says its forces are in Syria to protect the Zeinab Shrine in Damascus, a Shi'ite holy site. But since 2011, Iran has been a major backer of the Syrian regime in its war with rebel groups across the country, at first sending advisers, then forces from the IRGC and expanding far beyond the shrine area.\nIran has long expressed a desire to command a unified army in the region, particularly in Syria, and its growing power in Syria and Iraq is causing unease in Western capitals. In an interview with the Mashregh news agency last August, Mohammad Ali Falaki, an IRGC leader, announced formation of a unified army in Syria which appears to have come to loose fruition.\n\u201cIt would hardly be abnormal for Iran's IRGC to be controlling yet more Shia jihadists,\u201d said Talha Abdulrazaq, a researcher at the University of Exeter's Strategy and Security Institute.\nIn the long run, the formation of a unified army in Syria under Tehran supervision appears very practical, analysts say.\n\u201cIt seems plausible that the Syrian government shift the responsibility for management and organization of the militias, especially where financial burden is concerned,\u201d said Rasool Nafisi, a Middle East affairs expert in Washington.\nAsserting its military prowess would help Iran push its political agenda in the region, some analysts believe.\n\u201cThe bigger and more advanced army you control, the stronger voice you have,\u201d said Daryoush Babak, a Washington-based retired Iranian military adviser.\nBut unifying Assad supporters under Tehran\u2019s umbrella could worsen sectarian conflict in the region between Shi'ites and Sunni, analysts say.\nIran is looking for any chance to increase its influence and gain an upper hand against Saudi Arabia, its strongest rival in the war of minds and hearts, analysts say. Saudi Arabia and Iran support rival groups in Syria's civil war. And In a speech in Saudi Arabia, President Donald Trump accused Tehran of contributing to instability in the region.\n\"Tehran and Riyadh \u2026 keep contradicting each other to prove whose ideology leads the region,\" said Nafisi.\nWhile Syria has relied on Iran militarily in the fight against rebels and Islamic State, it\u2019s unlikely to grant Tehran a controlling foothold in the country, analysts say.\n\u201cIn Syria, it is not likely to happen as long as the Assad regime harbors ambitions of regaining sovereignty rather than being reduced to an Iranian protectorate,\u201d said Alfoneh.\nVOA\u2019s Noor Zahid contributed to this report.\n\n            ",

The pope is scheduled to hold his regular general audience in the square shortly after meeting Trump.\nFILE - A view of St. Peter's Square during Easter Mass celebrated by Pope Francis, at the Vatican, April 16, 2017.\nThe understated arrival, though, is reflective of an eagerness by both the White House and the Vatican to lower expectations. American and Vatican officials have been nervous in the run-up to the meeting.\nTense exchanges\nThe two men have never met, but they have traded pointed exchanges. Last year, in February, Trump accused Francis of allowing himself to be used as a political pawn by the Mexican government on the issue of migration. The pontiff responded by questioning then-candidate Trump\u2019s Christian faith, saying his plan to build a wall on the border with Mexico had no basis in the Gospel. \u201cA person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges is not Christian,\u201d the pontiff told reporters while flying to Mexico.\nFILE - Pope Francis speaks to journalists aboard the flight from Mexico to Italy, on Feb. 18, 2016.\nThat drew a harsh retort from Trump, who replied to Francis' comments with a three paragraph statement in which he warned the Vatican could be attacked by Islamic State terrorists and then church leaders would be grateful if he were in the White House. \u201cFor a religious leader to question a person\u2019s faith is disgraceful,\u201d Trump said.\nSince then the pair have not argued directly, but the pope, the spiritual leader of America\u2019s 50 million Catholics, has clearly been at odds with Trump on a range of issues, including climate change, asylum-seekers and nuclear arms.\nFILE - Pope Francis stands, looking across the Rio Grande towards Texas along the US-Mexico border, in Cuidad Juarez, Mexico, Feb. 17, 2016.\nBridging the divide \nEarlier this month, though, Francis was more conciliatory, saying the upcoming Trump visit offered an opportunity to listen to each other. \u201cI never make a judgment about a person without listening to them,\u201d the pontiff said. He followed up by saying, \u201cI will say what I think; he will say what he thinks.\u201d\nIn recent weeks there have been intense discussions about the agenda for the meeting, and, a Vatican official told VOA, they aimed to avoid \u201cmishap\u201d and to stage a partial reconciliation between the pope and the president. For the White House, a good visit at the Vatican will help further the goal of presenting Trump as a figure eager to unite three religions, Christianity, Judaism and Islam, in the fight against Islamic militants.\nPresident Donald Trump delivers a speech to the Arab Islamic American Summit, at the King Abdulaziz Conference Center, May 21, 2017, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.\nPapal aides told Corriere della Sera newspaper Sunday, \u201cthe meeting will be fine.\u201d Although the paper commented that it wasn\u2019t sure if this were a prediction, a wish or a prayer. An official told the newspaper that Melania Trump\u2019s attendance was being seen by some papal aides as useful, as it would likely help to prevent the encounter from becoming too hard-edged.\nBut for all their differences, the pope, who is highly political, is guided by a deep wish to forge unity and to build consensus and he sees disagreement as a useful dynamic, argue some Vatican-watchers. In Argentina, as a cardinal he strove to nurture relationships with diametrically opposed politicians and to build trust with them and between them, acting as a pastor.\nAmerican Catholics \nFrancis will also likely be mindful that six in 10 white American Catholics backed Trump in the November elections. There is already considerable tension between the Vatican and American Catholics, especially over the church\u2019s handling of child abuse by parish priests.\nWhile some U.S. and Italian reporters are anticipating the meeting between the pair as a possible prize-fight between ideological pugilists, some who know the pontiff say he will search for common ground and may focus on the downsides of globalization to the need to combat human trafficking.\nAusten Ivereigh, who has written a book on the pontiff, argued Sunday in Crux, a U.S.-based independent Catholic media outlet, \u201cPope Francis wants to be in a relationship with world leaders, whomever they are, and whatever their views, so that when the opportunity to work together arises, the bond is there.\u201d\n\n            ",

After years of restoration, the cathedral reopened just last weekend.\n\"There are those who remain buried in the rubble of life,\" the pope said in his homily before an estimated 20,000 gathered in the piazza outside the cathedral for an open-air Mass. \"And there are those, like you, who with the help of God rise from the rubble to rebuild.\"\nAnother 50,000 people watched the Mass on large screens throughout the city of 70,000.\nDuring his daylong visit, the pope also will meet with families who lost loved ones in the quake and hold a discussion with priests, nuns and seminarians.\nThe Emilia Romagna model of rebuilding after the magnitude-6.1 and magnitude-5.8 quakes that killed 28 people in 2012 has often been cited as exemplary. It included bringing together politicians, entrepreneurs and bishops to decide common priorities.\nThe papal visit was meant to give a sign of gratitude for the rebuilding, the archbishop of Carpi, Monsignor Francesco Cavina, told the Italian Bishops' Conference television TV2000. But he said it's also \"a sign of hope that rebuilding is possible for the people of central Italy, who unfortunately suffered what we did much more dramatically.\"\nA magnitude-6.1 quake on Aug. 24 in Italy's central regions of Umbria, Abruzzo and Marche killed nearly 300 people, toppled thousands of buildings including churches, historic buildings and museums, and rendered many town centers uninhabitable. It was followed by a series of quakes in October, including the strongest in Italy in nearly four decades at magnitude 6.6, that toppled and damaged a higher number of structures, but didn't provoke further deaths since the most vulnerable areas had already been evacuated.\nAuthorities have estimated the damage from the 2016 central Italian quakes at more than 23.5 billion euros ($25 billion), compared with 13.5 billion euros from the 2012 Emilia Romagna temblors.\n\n            ",

The United States, which in the past has blocked similar resolutions to protect its ally, Israel, abstained from the vote, allowing the measure to go through.\nIsrael expressed its anger at the outgoing Obama administration for allowing its adoption and announced it would limit diplomatic and business cooperation with countries on the Security Council that voted in favor of the resolution, including cutting several million dollars in foreign aid to council member Senegal.\nIsrael was further angered by a French-sponsored conference Sunday in Paris intended to reaffirm the international community's position that a two-state solution is the only answer to the decades-old conflict and urge the two parties to return to the negotiating table.

It also questioned testimonies of survivors who are currently outside of Syria. \u201cWhy didn't the Syrian authorities execute them and why were they released if others were executed?\u201d it said.\n\u201cThe justice ministry denies and condemns in the strongest terms what was reported because it is not based on correct evidence but on personal emotions that aim to achieve well-known political goals,\u201d the statement said.\nThe statement also said the report refers to judges and lawyers among those executed. However, there is no such reference in the report - Amnesty only states that it interviewed former judges and lawyers and that human rights defenders were among those imprisoned in Saydnaya.\nThe statement published on SANA Wednesday morning appeared to have been taken down later. It was not immediately clear why.\nSaydnaya has become the main political prison in Syria since 2011, according to witnesses. Amnesty said Damascus did not respond to its own request for comment ahead of the report's publication. Syrian government officials rarely comment on allegations of torture and mass killings. In the past, they have denied reports of massacres documented by international human rights groups, describing them as propaganda.\nAmnesty said its investigation revealed that Syrian authorities hanged between 5,000 and 13,000 people over the course of four years in Saydnaya - known by detainees as the 'slaughterhouse' and operated by the military police. The hangings took place once, sometimes twice a week, after trials that last only a few minutes, the report said.\nOther rights groups have found evidence of widespread torture leading to death in Syrian detention facilities. In a report last year, Amnesty found that more than 17,000 people have died of torture and ill-treatment in custody across Syria since 2011, an average rate of more than 300 a month.\n\n            ",

Iraqi army and federal police divisions are participating in the push along with the elite rapid response units who fall under federal police command, Rasool said.\nThe front lines in western Mosul have inched forward for months as IS fighters have used a claustrophobic battle space and hundreds of thousands of civilians as human shields to slow Iraqi troops. On the southern edge of Mosul's west, Iraq's federal police are just a few hundred meters (yards) from Mosul's al-Nuri mosque.\nThe mosque is a hugely symbolic prize as it is where IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi made a rare public appearance in July 2014 and declared the group's self-styled caliphate after IS seized almost a third of Iraq. But the mosque lies inside Mosul's old city where some of the toughest fighting is expected to unfold due to the narrow streets, according to coalition officials. Iraqi forces now appear to be moving to surround the old city before launching an operation to clear it.\nThe fight for Mosul's west has been slow and deadly to Iraqi forces and civilians caught in the crossfire. During a congressional hearing in March, Joseph Votel, head of U.S. Central Command, said the fight for Mosul had left 774 Iraqi security forces dead and 4,600 wounded. Iraq's military does not release casualty information for its forces.\nMore than six months of fighting has killed and wounded more than 8,000 civilians, according to the United Nations, a number that only counts people transferred to hospitals from frontline clinics.\nHundreds of thousands of people are still trapped inside the Mosul neighborhoods under IS control and some 419,000 people have been forced to flee western Mosul alone since the fighting began there, according to a U.N. statement released this week.\nMosul fell to IS nearly three years ago and the operation to retake it was launched in October. Iraqi forces declared the city's eastern half \"liberated\" in January.\n\n            ",

Lack of money is pushing the humanitarian crisis ever closer.\nAid agencies are haunted by the specter of the 2011 famine in the Horn of Africa, which killed more than 260,000 people, half of them children under age five. They do not want a repeat of that tragedy, but say they fear the severity of the current humanitarian crisis gripping Yemen, the Horn of Africa and neighboring countries could result in an even worse outcome.\nFILE - In this photo taken Feb. 25, 2017, displaced Somali girls who fled the drought in southern Somalia stand in a queue to receive food handouts at a feeding center in a camp in Mogadishu, Somalia.\nThe U.N. refugee agency reports hunger and conflict are forcing increasing numbers of people to flee within their countries and across borders in search of food and refuge. UNHCR spokesman Adrian Edwards says refugee numbers are escalating.\n\u201cConsecutive harvests have failed, conflict in South Sudan coupled with drought is leading to famine and outflows of refugees, insecurity in Somalia is leading to rising internal displacement, and rates of malnutrition are high, especially among children and lactating mothers,\u201d he said.\nEdwards says in the Dollo Ado area of southeast Ethiopia, acute malnutrition rates among very young newly arriving Somali refugee children are running between 50 and nearly 80 percent.\nAid agencies have been scaling up their humanitarian operations in northeastern Nigeria, South Sudan, Somalia and Yemen, where more than 20 million people are experiencing famine or are on the brink of famine.\nFILE - Somalis displaced by the drought, arrive at makeshift camps in the Tabelaha area on the outskirts of Mogadishu, Somalia, March 30, 2017.\nBut Edwards tells VOA the efforts may be doomed to failure, he warns problems will reach catastrophic levels unless funds are received.\n\u201cWhat we are looking at is the need for funding across the international community,\" he said. \"This is really is an absolutely critical situation that is rapidly unfolding across a large swathe of Africa from west to east.

Another 150 will be admitted in the next few weeks before it is closed.\nIn an open letter Tuesday addressed to Britain\u2019s Prime Minister Theresa May, the celebrities describe as \u201ctruly shameful\u201d the decision to stop the program. \u201cThe idea that as a country we will slam the door shut after just 350 children have reached safety is completely unacceptable,\u201d they wrote.\n\u201cThe country we know and love is better than this,\u201d they added.\nThe plan to admit lone child refugees wandering in Europe after fleeing the Mideast was never a government idea in the first place. The government set it up reluctantly after lawmakers and peers passed an amendment to new immigration legislation last April. The lawmakers expected the number of unaccompanied children admitted would be more like 3,000. It took five months after the passing of the amendment for the government to resettle any child refugees stranded in Europe.\nBritain\u2019s \"red-top\" tabloid newspapers reacted furiously when the first handful of child refugees, who had been at a camp in Calais, were admitted under the plan, arguing on the basis purely of photographs that they weren\u2019t kids. They raised the specter the resettled refugees posed a security risk, which some observers say influenced the government\u2019s already jaundiced attitude toward the program.\nFILE - One Syrian and five Afghan boys wave on the platform of the Calais train station, northern France, as they leave for Britain, Oct. 13, 2016.\nThe amendment creating the program was proposed by Alf Dubs, a Labour peer who as a six-year-old was one of 669 mostly Jewish children who fled Czechoslovakia in 1939 and were admitted into Britain thanks to the voluntary efforts of a young British stockbroker, Nicholas Winton.\nIn their letter, the celebrities noted the plan wouldn\u2019t match Winton\u2019s efforts in wartime Europe by the time it is closed. Nor, they argue, will it compare favorably to Britain\u2019s Kindertransport humanitarian program, which ran between November 1938 to September 1939 and oversaw the admittance of 10,000 mostly Jewish children who fled Nazi Europe.\nThe wartime government agreed to speed up the immigration process by issuing travel documents to the Kindertransport children on the basis of group lists, rather than individual applications.\nAnnouncing the winding down of the so-called \"Dubs scheme\", government Minster Amber Rudd argued last Thursday, \u201cit acts as a magnet and encourages people traffickers.\u201d She said most vulnerable children were stuck in camps in Jordan and Lebanon, from where the government still intends to bring 3,000 to Britain, the number lawmakers were led to believe would be admitted under the Dubs amendment.\nActress Joely Richardson (C) stands with Alf Dubs and demonstrators portraying Paddington Bear, during a protest highlighting the plight of child refugees, outside the Home Office in London, Oct. 24, 2016.\nBut refugee campaigners doubt the sincerity of the government when it comes to increasing the tally of refugees from the Mideast and Horn of Africa. Especially as a separate, accelerated arrangement to bring in unaccompanied refugee children who have family members already living in Britain is to be scrapped also.\nThe government\u2019s argument the \"Dubs scheme\" incentivizes children to make perilous journeys across Europe that risk them falling into the hands of people traffickers, is dismissed by refugee campaigners. They say with or without resettlement plans in Europe and Britain refugees will keep coming.\nFILE - Two members a group of unaccompanied minors (R and 2nd R) from the Jungle migrant camp in Calais stand outside an immigration centre after being processed after their arrival in Britain, in Croydon, south London, Oct. 18, 2016.\nEnding the program will put child refugees more at the mercy of traffickers, argues Aidan McQuade, director of Anti-Slavery International, a London-based rights group.\n\u201cThe absence of a comprehensive approach to the refugee crisis in the Mediterranean, particularly the absence of safe migration options for vulnerable people fleeing war has been the single greatest factor to increase the risk of human trafficking in Europe over the past two years,\u201d he said.\nThe comparisons campaigners and Alf Dubs have drawn with the Kindertransport and the Holocaust has drawn impassioned rebuttals from opponents. \u201cNeither the Syrian civil war, brutal and unspeakable as it is, nor any other current conflict can be compared to the Holocaust,\u201d argues commentator Melanie Phillips.\nWriting in The Times newspaper, she said. \u201cToday\u2019s migrant crisis is part of a mass movement of people, not all of them refugees, which threatens to engulf western Europe ... It is nauseating that the Holocaust is being used as an emotional bludgeon, so that anyone who supports restrictions on today\u2019s migrants is not only attacked as a heartless monster, but also for somehow betraying the memory of the victims of Nazism.\u201d\nIn January 2016, Europol, a European Union agency, estimated 10,000 child refugees had disappeared after arriving unaccompanied in Europe. The agency said it feared many had become victims of exploitation. European authorities estimated that nearly 90,000 unaccompanied children from the Middle East and Africa sought asylum in Europe in 2015.\n\n            ",

The inside of the home is coated with something that looks like yellow sulfur powder.\nThe smell inside is overwhelming.

(H. Murdock/VOA)\nShortly after the attack early this month, local officials said the Hamad home and at least four other civilian houses in eastern Mosul were bombed by Islamic State militants with weapons containing homemade chemical poisons. International Committee of the Red Cross doctors said patients' symptoms indicated mustard gas. \nSome Iraqi officials later said that they had not seen evidence IS has the capacity to deploy chemical weapons. Others in Mosul qualified that statement, saying IS has only the capacity to use crude homemade chemical weapons that emit non-deadly poisons.\nIn the neighborhoods that were hit, families say they care less about what hit them than about getting it cleaned up. But chemical cleanup requires some expertise, and cannot be done with soap and water, says Yahya Kassim, a 51-year-old father of seven who was hospitalized after a bomb emitting foul-smelling black oil fell in his yard in early March.\nOutside Yahya Kassim's house, the chemical smell is still pungent, but has been weakened after a neighbor paid someone to remove some of the poisoned debris in Mosul, Iraq, March 22, 2017. (H. Murdock/VOA)\n\"They should come to my house and smell it,\" he said in the yard. The smell is less pungent than it was last week because a neighbor paid for the removal of some of the poisoned bricks scattered in the attack. But the sickening odor returns in the rain, he said. \n\"Or tell them to call me,\" he added. \"I'll explain what happened.\" \n'Contingency planning'\nAt an Irbil hospital on Friday, Hamad's wife and five children are recovering and are planning to be released Saturday.\nThe family is better but they still have damaged immune systems, said Dr. Johannes Schad of ICRC.\nWeeks after the bombings, locals near suspected chemical attacks say they are still developing symptoms, like this man's rash, in Mosul, Iraq, March 22, 2017. (H. Murdock/VOA)\nAt least 15 patients have been treated in Irbil in recent weeks for symptoms consistent with chemical attacks, including blistering skin, and respiratory and eye problems. Near the bombings in Mosul, dozens of people tell us they have experienced symptoms but have very little access to health care.\nAnd while there have been no new reports of suspected chemical weapons in recent weeks, international organizations continue to build capacity, preparing for more victims of chemical weapons.\n\"You can see this is some kind of chemical agent,\" Schad said. \"We are contingency planning. The situation is getting more tense.\"\nIraqi forces say the battle for Mosul has never been fiercer than now, as it moves in on the last quarter of the city held by IS. In previous months, militants often fled as Iraqi forces moved in. Now, they are surrounded and fighting back with everything they can.\nThe battle for Mosul's Old City is expected to be one of the deadliest fights amid operations that have displaced nearly 275,000 people since October in Mosul, Iraq, March 23, 2017. (H. Shekha/VOA)\nAs the fighting gets more intense, the humanitarian crisis surrounding the war has become overwhelming, with nearly 275,000 people displaced since operations began in October. Trauma centers have seen at least 5,000 civilian patients.\nAnd among the displaced could soon be Hamad and his family, as his home is no longer livable. \n\"I don't know where we will go,\" he said, standing by the hospital room door. \"Even if we go to friends or relatives, we can stay only for a few days.\"\nTest results\nIn Mosul, patients released weeks ago show us ICRC documents that call them \"suspected victim[s] of mustard gas,\" but no one we speak to has received formal test results. \nYahya Kassim, 51, says he was tested for chemical poisoning weeks ago after his house was bombed, but he still hasn't seen any results in Mosul, Iraq, March 22, 2017. (H. Murdock/VOA)\nThe ICRC says they have not received results of tests taken in early March.

Shops and businesses remained closed in the Kashmiri capital, Srinagar.\nPolice fired tear gas in at least four places where protesters attempted to march in the streets.\nThe tightest security was in Tral village around the house of Wani, who had joined the Hizbul Mujahideen militant group and is regarded as a hero in Kashmir. He belonged to a new rank of social media savvy young rebels who used Facebook and other social media to draw fresh recruits.\nThe call for a strike to mark Wani\u2019s killing was given by local Kashmiri separatist leaders and by a Pakistan-based militant commander, Syed Salahuddin, whom the United States last week added to its list of global terrorists.\nViolent protests\nKashmir has been restive ever since widespread violent street protests that erupted after his killing.\n\u201cThe mood is defiance, not much has changed in the past one year since his killing,\u201d said Shujaat Bukhari, editor of Rising Kashmir newspaper. Calling Wani a \u201ctrigger\u201d for a situation that had been simmering for a long time, Bukhari said \u201cHe became a rallying point, in a way he united Kashmiris in their anger and angst against the Indian state.\u201d\nMembers of a Kashmiri youth group hold posters of young rebel leader Burhan Wani, killed by Indian troops last year, while chanting anti-Indian slogans during a rally to mark the first anniversary of his death, in Lahore, Pakistan, July 8, 2017.\nThe present round of unrest in India\u2019s only Muslim majority region has shattered a long spell of relative calm that Kashmir witnessed following a violent separatist insurgency in the 1990s.\nAnd this time, civilians are playing a greater role in the unrest.

Now, \u201cif they do get in the country, we do not let them leave,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIf we are able to block ivory from being smuggled out of the country then we will destroy it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have been able to effectively arrest more and more suspects with tangible results.\u201d\nDeputy Police Commissioner Gen. Chalermkiat Sriworakhan talks to reporters at Royal Thai Police Headquarters in Bangkok, Thailand, July 7, 2017. Police in Thailand are claiming great success for a government policy to curb trafficking in ivory.\nNew laws, amendments\nThailand had been considered to have the largest unregulated ivory market in the world and had been threatened with sanctions on the trade of protected wildlife species, but it introduced new laws and amendments in 2014 and 2015. The Elephant Ivory Act regulates the domestic ivory market and criminalizes the sale of African elephant ivory.\nThe wildlife trade monitoring network TRAFFIC praised Thailand for a large drop in sales of ivory items resulting from the crackdown aimed at shedding the country's image as a center for the illicit trade in wildlife goods.\nIts survey of Bangkok markets found a decline in the amount of ivory openly for sale from a high of 7,421 items in 2014 to 283 products in June 2016. Measured over a slightly longer period of time, the drop was even more dramatic. In December 2013 the number of ivory items openly on sale was 14,512, according to earlier surveys by TRAFFIC.\n\u201cThailand's legal reforms have paved the way for greater control of the domestic ivory market and it's certainly something other countries in the region should emulate, especially Laos, Vietnam, and Myanmar,\u201d Kanitha Krishnasamy, acting regional director for TRAFFIC in Southeast Asia, said in an email Friday. \u201cFurther to these efforts, it's important also to test products in the market to ensure that no African elephant ivory is in the marketplace.\u201d\nBiggest demand from China\nPoachers have killed tens of thousands of African elephants for their tusks to meet demand for ivory in Asia, putting the species at great risk. Thailand became a major transit hub and destination for smuggled tusks, which are often carved into tourist trinkets and ornaments.

The attack left a scene of mayhem and destruction in the Afghan capital.\nA look at some of the lingering questions after the attack:\nHow was this possible?\nInvestigators will seek to understand how insurgents managed to get an explosives-packed tanker truck into one of the best-protected areas of Kabul. The Wazir Akbar Khan district is home to most of the capital's foreign embassies as well as several major government institutions, including the Presidential Palace.\n\"No one could even imagine that would take place in Wazir Akbar Khan,\" said General Mirza Mohammad Yarmand, a former deputy interior minister. \"I would call it a security and intelligence error.\"\nCan the government protect the capital?\nThe bombing raises serious questions about the Afghan government's ability to provide basic security. Insurgent groups have been on the offensive ever since the drawdown of NATO troops from the country in 2014.\nThe first half of 2017 has seen a particularly successful string of terrorist attacks in the capital, including a twin suicide bombing March 1 that killed 22 people and a coordinated March 8 assault on a military hospital that killed 50 people.\nWho did it?\nAs of late Wednesday night in Kabul, no one had claimed responsibility. The vast majority of such devastating attacks recently have been undertaken by either the Taliban or the local affiliate of the Islamic State group.\nThe Taliban has been waging a guerrilla war against Kabul for more than a decade \u2014 ever since being ousted from power by a U.S. invasion in 2001 in the aftermath of 9/11. The Islamic State group is a more recent development, forming in the last few years and largely made up of dissident former Taliban militants. IS has been battling the Taliban for control of certain parts of Afghanistan while also regularly targeting the government.\nYarmand said he didn't think the Taliban were behind it, saying they \"don't have the ability to carry out such big attack, and if they did, they would have claimed responsibility.\"\nThe former Interior Ministry official repeated a common belief among Afghan government officials: The Pakistani intelligence services have played a role in the string of terrorist attacks plaguing Kabul. Pakistani officials have repeatedly denied such accusations.\nIs there a diplomatic solution?\nSo far, it doesn't appear likely.\nThere have been multiple attempts to launch peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban, but all have faltered. The most recent initiative, brokered by Pakistan, collapsed and spawned even more public distrust and animosity between Kabul and Islamabad.\nWhat's more, as long as the Taliban and other insurgent groups can demonstrate the ability to strike deep in the heart of the most secure parts of Kabul, the impetus to negotiate will likely be reduced.

He called stories that he had once hung up the phone on the prime minister \u201ca little bit of fake news, as the saying goes.\u201d\nIn remarks at the dinner, Trump said he and Turnbull had discussed \u201ccrucial issues ranging from international security to trade.\u201d He said the two leaders had \u201creaffirmed the tremendous friendship\u201d between the two countries and the \u201cvital importance\u201d of a continued alliance with one another.\nWatch: Related video report \nVideo size\nwidth\nx\nheight\npixels\nTrump Smoothes Relations With Australian PM at WWII Battle Anniversary\nShare this video\n0:02:07\n\u25b6\n0:00:00\n/0:02:07\n\u25b6\n\u25b6\nDirect link\n270p | 6.2MB\n360p | 10.7MB\n720p | 58.6MB\n1080p | 43.4MB\nConfidence and trust\n\u201cWe are confident and we trust each other,\u201d Turnbull said of the countries\u2019 relationship during his remarks. He and Trump also expressed gratitude to a handful of elderly veterans of the Battle of Coral Sea, which occurred 75 years ago this week.\nNoting that Australian and U.S. forces worked together to repel Japanese forces trying to take control of the Pacific waters near Australia, Turnbull said, \u201cour nation\u2019s freedom was secured by the bravery of the men on those ships. And the men on the planes who flew through everything the enemy, and the weather, threw their way.\u201d\nTurnbull concluded his remarks with a tribute to the current members of the U.S. and Australian military forces, saying, \u201cYou keep us free.\u201d\n/*<![CDATA[*/\ninitInfographics(\n{\ngroups:[],\nparams:[{\"Name\":\"embed_html\",\"Value\":\"\\u0026lt;blockquote class=\\\"twitter-tweet\\\" data-partner=\\\"tweetdeck\\\"\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;p lang=\\\"en\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\"\\u0026gt;An honor to welcome PM of Australia, \\u0026lt;a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/TurnbullMalcolm\\\"\\u0026gt;@TurnbullMalcolm\\u0026lt;/a\\u0026gt; to America \\u0026amp;amp; join him in marking the 75th Anniversary of the Battle of the Coral Sea. \\u0026lt;a href=\\\"https://t.co/uvkxLWNBpV\\\"\\u0026gt;pic.twitter.com/uvkxLWNBpV\\u0026lt;/a\\u0026gt;\\u0026lt;/p\\u0026gt;\u2014 Donald J.

A bilateral military alliance dates back to the early 1950s.\nLate arrival to New York\nTrump arrived in New York later than planned, delaying his scheduled meeting with the prime minister by several hours while he remained in Washington until the House of Representatives signed a pivotal health care bill that would replace the Affordable Care Act. Getting rid of the health care reform plan nicknamed Obamacare was one of Trump\u2019s key campaign promises.\nDespite the wait, the two leaders were all smiles following a short meeting after Trump arrived in New York.\nFILE - In this Jan. 28, 2017, file photo, President Donald Trump speaks on the telephone with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington.\nThis is the first face-to-face meeting between the two men since Trump abruptly ended an introductory phone call with Turnbull in February. Trump objected to a pre-existing agreement between Washington and Canberra that the U.S. would accept some refugees currently in Australian custody.\nTrump reportedly called the deal \u201cdumb\u201d and \u201cthe worst deal ever\u201d before ending the call. He also is reported to have told Turnbull that he had spoken to four other world leaders that day, but that his phone call with Turnbull \u201cwas the worst call by far.\u201d\nTurnbull later denied reports that the American president had hung up on him. He said in a radio interview: \u201cThe call ended courteously, that\u2019s all I want to say about that.\u201d\nAfter the dinner, Trump is not expected to go to his Manhattan headquarters, Trump Tower, but instead will spend the weekend at his golf resort in Bedminster, New Jersey.\nPhil Mercer contributed to this report from Sydney, Australia\n\n            ",

(Sok Khemara/VOA Khmer)\nAs a district chief in the northwestern province of Banteay Meanchey, Im Chaem allegedly ran a forced labor camp to construct an irrigation project and was accused of responsibility for the deaths of possibly thousands of laborers.\nThe tribunal's statement also said that under the agreement that was negotiated to establish the tribunal, no other Cambodian courts have jurisdiction over human rights violations committed by members of the communist Khmer Rouge, whose harsh 1975-79 rule is generally considered responsible for the deaths of 1.7 million people from execution, overwork and neglect of medical care.\nThe absence of an alternative court to try such cases means \"only a certain small group of people will ever be prosecuted in the courts of Cambodia for the atrocities\" during Khmer Rouge rule, it said.\n\"It is undoubtedly difficult for the public and the victims to accept that even the soldiers who routinely killed small children by bashing their heads against trees or who had competitions about who could kill the greatest number of people, should not face justice,\" the statement said.\n\"In many domestic criminal justice systems, such conduct would attract a whole life sentence without parole and in some countries possibly even the death penalty for each individual act of each individual offender.\"\nThe agreement to limit such cases to the U.N.-assisted tribunal \"was a conscious political choice during the negotiations, balancing the call for integration of the remaining Khmer Rouge into society against the desire for some form of judicial closure for the horrendous suffering of the victims,\" the statement said.\nThe tribunal has already convicted two high-ranking Khmer Rouge leaders, Khieu Samphan, the 85-year-old Khmer Rouge head of state, and Nuon Chea, the 90-year-old right-hand man to the group's late top leader, Pol Pot. A second trial of the two on separate charges was recently concluded and is awaiting a verdict.\nAlso convicted earlier was the head of its prison system, who ran a torture center in Phnom Penh. Cases against a handful of other suspects are in the judicial pipeline.\nThe head of the Documentation Center of Cambodia, which has collected massive amounts of detailed evidence about the Khmer Rouge, said he was disappointed with the statement's explanation.\nIts redaction of the evidence against Im Chaem \u2014 based on the rule of presumption of innocence \u2014 means that the public at large is unable to judge the correctness of the decision to dismiss the case, Youk Chhang said in an email.\nHe accused the co-investigating judges of \"compromising justice.\"\nThe tribunal's statement said the evidence collected by the center dealing with the charges against Im Chaem could not be taken into account because it was gathered in a manner not suitable for legal purposes.\n\n            ",

It said it had an additional 300 to 500 troops in the country to support regular training and activities, without giving further details.\nA U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said support included aerial surveillance and targeting, electronic eavesdropping, communications assistance and training. A U.S. P-3 Orion surveillance plane was seen over the town on Friday.\n'Our soldiers are pro-American'\nDuterte, who declared martial law on Mindanao \u2014 an island the size of South Korea \u2014 after the Islamist fighters overran Marawi, said that under martial law he has authority over the defense department.\nHe did not say the armed forces had gone over his head but noted that, because of years of training from the United States, \"our soldiers are pro-American, that I cannot deny.\"\nPresidential spokesperson Ernesto Abella said in a statement U.S. forces were participating directly in combat operations, which is prohibited by Philippines law.\n\"The fight against terrorism, however, is not only the concern of the Philippines or the United States but it is a concern of many nations around the world,\" he said. \"The Philippines is open to assistance from other countries if they offer it.\"\nAs of Saturday the number of security forces killed in the battle for Marawi stood at 58. The death toll for civilians was 20 and more than 100 had been killed overall.\nAt least 200 militants are holed up in a corner of the town.\nAn estimated 500 to 1,000 civilians are trapped there, some being held as human shields, while others are hiding in their homes with no access to running water, electricity or food.\nOne of the main Islamist factions dug in around the heart of the city is the Maute group, a relative newcomer amid the throng of insurgents, separatists and bandits on Mindanao.\nMaute joined forces with Isnilon Hapilon, who was last year proclaimed by Islamic State as its Southeast Asia \"emir.\"\nMilitary officials believe Hapilon is still in the town.\nThe military has said it is aiming to end the siege by Monday, the Philippines' independence day.\n\n            ",

It soured when Australia supported East Timorese independence from Indonesia in 2002. \nMore recently in 2015, diplomatic tension rose when Jakarta executed two members of an Australian drug trafficking gang despite pleas for mercy from Canberra. In January, Indonesia briefly suspended bilateral military ties after a dispute at an Australian Special Forces base in Perth. \nOptimism for trade progress\nThose anxieties have soothed, and there is optimism that Widodo\u2019s visit will see meaningful progress on a free trade agreement.\nAaron Connelly, an analyst at the Lowy Institute, a Sydney-based think tank, says ties between the two countries are in good shape.\n\u201cThe remarkable thing here is that despite that background of irritation that we see on occasion, relations between the two are actually pretty good,\u201d Connelly said. \u201cMinisters on both sides have good relationships with their counterparts, and you also have Australian feelings towards Indonesia at a high.\n\u201cIn our Lowy Institute poll last year we asked Australians to rank countries on a thermometer from zero to 100, and Indonesia ranked at 56 degrees, which is the highest result we have ever seen in 11 years of polling,\u201d he added.\nSouth China Sea also on agenda\nWidodo and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull are also expected to discuss the dangers posed by radicalized fighters returning home from the conflict in Iraq and Syria. Tensions over the South China Sea are an additional topic on the agenda, along with the possibility of joint navy patrols in the area.\nWhile significant, the Indonesian leader\u2019s visit to Sydney will be brief.

Syrians here face legal and other forms of discrimination, and many parents are hesitant to let their children play outside in the crowded alleys of Beirut's poorer neighborhoods, where most of the refugees live.\nThe monthlong Hoops program provides a safe environment where the children can blow off steam, as well as learn self-confidence and teamwork.\n\u201cThey come back home and they're too tired to fight,\u201d smiles Fatima Tayjan, a refugee from the Syrian city of Aleppo who has enrolled three of her four children in the program. When her family of six returns home to their crowded two-bedroom apartment, the children have \u201creleased all their energy and they are ready to talk to each other,\u201d she said.\nMaram al-Malwa, a 17-year-old paid volunteer who came up in the program, recalls her own feelings of isolation when she and her family fled from Aleppo to Lebanon five years ago. \u201cIt was a new country, even a new accent,\u201d she said.\nBut now she is irrepressible, rising on the balls of her feet when she speaks and helping coaches reach through to children in the group activities. She is one of a handful of the children pulled aside for a six-month mentorship on leadership and coaching. \n\u201cYou grow, you experience victories, setbacks, you learn to fight for yourself, and you become more confident,\u201d she said.\nWhen hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled their homes or were forced into Lebanon during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, they set to work mending the national fabric through schools, scouts, and athletics, with the support of Arab nationalist groups.\nBut Syrians have not been able to count on the same sense of solidarity. And as the U.N. and aid groups have struggled to assist the nearly 5 million Syrian refugees scattered across the region, the focus has been on schooling, aid and shelter, with few resources left over for cultural or recreational activities. \n\u201cChildren won't necessarily express themselves unless you give them an outlet, and sports are an excellent medium to do so,\u201d said Nakib, the technical director.\nRania Qadri, who fled from Syria's southern Daraa province, said she saw her oldest daughter change before her eyes.\n\u201cShe used to be introverted, she wouldn't speak to anyone,\u201d she said. \u201cNow she comes home and tells me, `I've made friends, we've been playing soccer, we've been playing games and sports.\u201d'\nStaffers are trained to identify struggling children, those who lash out and those who retreat into their shells. Psychologists meet with parents weekly to discuss healthy relationships and domestic violence.\nThe group sessions often bring to light domestic disputes, learning disabilities or experiences of sexual violence. The children are then referred to specialized non-governmental organizations for further support.\nIn other cases, children will reveal that they are not enrolled in school, and staffers will direct them to organizations that can help. Two-thirds of Syrian children in Lebanon do not attend school, according to U.N. figures, in part because the country's underfunded public education system has been overwhelmed by the new arrivals.\nOn a recent Sunday, the children lined up to dribble through cones, shoot layups and learn cheers and stretches.\n\u201cYou see a lot of cases of shyness or stubbornness, and you immediately see them change when they're here,\u201d said al-Malwa, the teenage volunteer. \u201cI feel like I'm responsible, like I'm in charge of a group.\u201d \n\n            ",

Elections are a complicated logistical exercise that blends colorful pageantry with more serious political issues. A village fair atmosphere takes over rural India as people troop to the nearest voting stations. \nFive key states - Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Goa, Manipur and Uttarakhand - are currently in the middle of elections to choose local legislatures. The voting began Feb. 4 and ends on March 8. Votes from all the state polls will be counted on March 11. A look at some of the key election features: \nElection symbols\nA bottle, an air conditioner, a television set, a lantern, an arrow, a bicycle, a loaf of bread - these are not shopping items but some of the many objects voters will see on the electronic voting machines as symbols for the dozens of political parties and independent candidates in the fray.\nSymbols have been allocated to political parties since India's first national election in 1951. Since barely a fifth of the population could read or write in the early 1950s, the symbols were introduced on ballot papers to help the unlettered cast their votes. Nearly three-quarters of Indians can now read but the icons remain evocative symbols of the major political groups.\nIndia's best-known political symbols are the lotus flower for the governing Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and the outstretched hand or palm for the main opposition Congress party.\nThe newest political party in the country, the Aam Aadmi Party, or the Common Man's Party, chose the broom as its election symbol, reflecting their claim that they mean to sweep clean the political system.\nThe choice of symbols still available for selection with the country's independent Election Commission includes an electric pole, cricket bat, pliers and even food items including a coconut and a cauliflower. Also available: a toothbrush and nail clippers. \nFreebies\nElection season in India is the time when political parties offer freebies in return for the votes.\nOn offer this year are promises of laptops, smartphones, spice grinders, fans and loan waivers. The governing BJP is even offering sugar and clarified butter at low prices in northern Punjab state. \nIn the past, farm workers got cows and goats in a southern state. Freebies are a fact of life in Indian politics. Some 270 million people - nearly 22 per cent of the country's population - live in poverty, making giveaways particularly attractive to voters.\nThe election-season freebies, however, raise questions about a fair playing field for smaller parties and independent candidates.\nIn the absence of laws barring such campaign promises, the practice continues. In India's northern Uttar Pradesh, Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, the state's top elected official, is promising free smartphones. In the previous 2014 election, he fulfilled his promise of free laptops for students after winning the vote. \nHis main challenger, the BJP, also promised laptops, free internet and cooking gas to those who vote for them.\nElection funding\nAnonymous cash donations to political parties, running into billions of rupees (hundreds of millions of dollars) are seen at the heart of India's endemic corruption.\nOnly a quarter of the annual income of the two main political parties, the BJP and the Congress party, comes from known sources and are declared in their tax returns. The rest is from anonymous donors, according to the Association of Democratic Reforms, a non-political group working for governmental and electoral reform. \nCorruption is a top issue in the elections, which came on the heels of a surprise Nov. 8 announcement by Prime Minister Narendra Modi eliminating the country's highest denominated currency bills in what he called an attack on tax fraud and graft.\nThe government also appears to have taken some steps to bring transparency to party funding.\nOn Feb. 1, India's Finance Minister Arun Jaitley announced in his budget speech that political parties will not be allowed to accept donations of more than 2,000 rupees ($29) in cash from an individual donor, instead of the 20,000 rupees ($295) allowed at present. \nA powerful regional group, the Bahujan Samaj Party, showed all donations it has received so far to be anonymous - below the legal limit of 20,000 rupees per donor. \nBut several economists say that if the government were really serious about transparency, it should ban all cash donations.\n\n            ",

They say people in Greece and the Balkan states are most at risk.\nCecile Pouilly, spokeswoman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, said Friday that her agency had transferred hundreds of people to better accommodations on the Greek islands of Lesbos and Chios over the past few days, but she noted that about 1,000 people, including young children, were continuing to live in unheated tents and dormitories on the island of Samos.\nShe said that UNHCR also has provided heated accommodations and relief items to more than 82 percent of the 7,300 refugees, asylum-seekers and migrants living in Serbia. \nA migrant wakes up after spending the night inside a crumbling warehouse that has served as a makeshift shelter for hundreds of men trying to reach Western Europe in Belgrade, Serbia, Jan. 12, 2017. Migrants have been exposed to freezing temperatures and snow as extreme winter weather gripped Serbia and other parts of Europe in the last week.\nHowever, Pouilly said, more must be done. She says her agency has received disturbing reports of refugee and migrant deaths as they move across Europe.\n\"We are extremely concerned by reports that several refugees and migrants have lost their lives trying to enter or move across Europe, including five deaths since the beginning of the year, due to the freezing weather,\" she said.\nOver the past few days, she noted that the bodies of two Iraqi men, who had died from the effects of cold and exhaustion, were found in southeastern Bulgaria after they had crossed from Turkey.\nIn the same region, the body of a young Somali woman was found, while two Somali teenagers traveling with her were hospitalized with frostbite.\n\"The Bulgarian authorities have reinforced patrols in the area since to prevent fatalities due to the weather,\u201d Pouilly said.\nHowever, Pouilly said, reports indicate that authorities in all countries along the Western Balkans route were continuing to push refugees and migrants out of their territories. \n\"In several cases, refugees and migrants have alleged that police have subjected them to violence,\" she said. \"Many have also reported that their phones were confiscated or destroyed, thus preventing them from calling for help once stranded.\"\nShe called these and other practices \"simply inacceptable\" and said they must be halted. She also expressed deep concern at abuses committed against refugees and migrants by criminal gangs, \"including kidnapping, physical abuse, threats and extortion.\"\nMigrant Petram Mehdi, 2, from Tehran, Iran, stands by the window of his family's shelter at the refugee camp of Ritsona about 86 kilometers (53 miles) north of Athens, Jan. 12, 2017.\nUNICEF, the U.N. Children's Fund, also has raised the alarm over the increasingly dire situation of children exposed to freezing cold weather conditions on the Greek islands. \nSarah Crowe, UNICEF spokeswoman, said thousands of children and their families have been living in limbo for many months on end. She said they were living under \"intolerable conditions\" in extremely overcrowded camps.\nBecause it's the off-season for tourism and few visitors are arriving, the agency appealed to Greek authorities to allow the refugees and migrants living out in the open to stay in the hotels, hostels and homes that are essentially empty.\nCrowe said children were unable to go to school and had no access to proper health services while they were stuck on those islands.\n\"We call on the authorities to speed up the process of relocation to bring these families to the main islands if accommodation, proper accommodation cannot be found on the islands,\" she said. \"Children are particularly prone to respiratory illnesses at a time like this. We do not want to see this happen. It is about saving lives, not about red tape and keeping to bureaucratic arrangements.\"\nMeanwhile, the International Organization for Migration has reported a steep decline in the number of Mediterranean migrant arrivals so far this year as compared to the same period last year.\nIOM reports that 1,159 migrants and refugees have arrived in Greece and Italy through January 12, compared to 22,590 during the first 12 days of 2016.\n\n            ",

Gen. Stephen Townsend, who commands the U.S.-led coalition working to defeat Islamic State, was more explicit. \"I don't anticipate that we'll be asked to leave by the government of Iraq immediately after Mosul. I think the government of Iraq realizes this is a very complex fight and they're going to need the assistance of the coalition even beyond Mosul.\"\nOn Monday, Iraqi forces advanced into the southern outskirts of Mosul on the second day of a push to drive Islamic State militants from the city's western part. Forces targeted a hill that overlooks the city's airport, entering the village of Abu Saif.\nMattis' stop in Iraq includes meetings with Townsend, as well as with Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi and other Iraqi officials. Mattis is working on his own plan to accelerate the fight against Islamic State, which Trump ordered on January 28 be delivered to him within 30 days.\nAs the Mosul offensive began Sunday, Mattis said the U.S. role, which has been to conduct airstrikes and serve as advisers to Iraqi troops, will remain the same. \n\"The attack into the city is something I don\u2019t want to go into details about because I owe confidentiality to the troops who are actually making the attack. At the same time, we are very close to it if not already engaged in that, in that fight,\" he said. \"The U.S. forces continue in the same role that they were in East Mosul and the coalition forces are in support of this operation, and we will continue as you know with the accelerated effort to destroy ISIS.\" \nIraqi troops pushed Islamic State out of the eastern part of Mosul last month after a campaign that lasted more than 100 days.

And don't forget that long-promised vacation with his wife.\nLooming retirement is looking like anything but for the 44th president.\nObama's next chapter starts Friday when he becomes an ex-president. He'll be freer to speak his mind, set his own schedule and make some money.\nAlready, Obama is looking ahead to the book he wants to write, and has had talks with Hollywood agent Ari Emanuel about arrangements that could include speaking gigs.\nAt 55, Obama will be a relatively young ex-president, with plenty of time for a second act. He's ruled out running another campaign for political office - so has his wife - but he has pledged to stay active in the national conversation.\nWith President-elect Donald Trump headed to the White House, Democrats are eager for Obama to play the role of shadow-president, offering direction to those Americans who feel they lost their political compass the day Trump was elected.\nObama has said he has plenty of ideas for how his party can revive itself, but after eight years as president, his role will be to offer guidance, not to micromanage.\n\"I think it's appropriate for me to give advice, because I need some sleep,\" Obama told NPR last month. \"And I've promised Michelle a nice vacation. My girls are getting old enough now where I'm clinging to those very last moments before they are out of the house.\"\nObama is expected to keep a low profile for the first few months after Trump's swearing-in.\nFollowing some relaxation time with his wife and daughters in an unnamed location, the family will return to Washington, where they've rented a mansion in the upscale Kalorama neighborhood.\nObama has repeatedly praised George. W. Bush for giving him room to operate without having the ex-president publicly second-guess him at every turn. Still, Obama has reserved the right to speak out against Trump if he pursues policies the president finds particularly odious, such as a ban on Muslim immigration or mass deportation of children brought to the U.S. illegally.\n\"The party is in bad state and there are no clear, obvious voices for Democrats yet,\" said Julian Zelizer, a presidential historian at Princeton University. \"If there's anyone who could stand up to a President Trump, it's going to be former President Obama.\"\nObama may re-emerge in a more public way around the time he releases his book - probably sometime next year - and goes on a promotional tour. Obama's chief White House speechwriter, Cody Keenan, is expected to stay with his boss to help him craft the sequel to Obama's two previous best-sellers.\nThough Obama has yet to fully settle his plans, four individuals familiar with Obama's thinking said over the last year that he's discussed post-presidency arrangements with Emanuel, a leading talent executive. One of Emanuel's brothers is Obama's former chief of staff, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel.\nIt's unclear whether Obama will sign with Ari Emanuel. But the discussions suggest Obama has been looking to Hollywood for inspiration about ways to engage creatively and on multiple fronts, such as digital media and television. Emanuel didn't respond to a request for comment.\nWhatever direction he chooses, Obama will not be pressed financially. He can expect to fetch an advance of more than $20 million for his book, said Keith Urbahn, a literary agent at Javelin DC who's handled best-sellers for top political figures.\n\"Half of the country still looks at him as their leader,\" Urbahn said. \"From a publishing perspective, he will probably end up with the highest advance of any ex-president in history.\"\nIt won't be long until Obama and his wife start raising money for the Barack Obama Foundation, which is developing his presidential library and center in Chicago. The price tag is expected to approach half a billion dollars.\nThe Obamas will have to hire personnel in the coming months as they engage more heavily in designing the center. While it will be several years before the library is up and running, the foundation has left open the possibility it might start some programming sooner.\nFormer White House aide Amy Brundage, a spokeswoman for the foundation, said it would use 2017 to \"build upon the work that has begun\" to create a center that inspires people to take on big challenges.\nObama also plans to stay involved in his My Brother's Keeper initiative, recently renamed the \"Task Force on Improving the Lives of Boys and Young Men of Color and Underserved Youth.\" He is also teaming up with former Attorney General Eric Holder on the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, a new initiative to improve Democrats' hand when political districts are redrawn in 2020.\nThe hub of Obama's activity will be his personal office, to be housed in the World Wildlife Fund headquarters not far from his rented home. For the first six months, he'll also have a government-funded office overseeing his transition to ex-president.\n\n            ",

More than 9,800 people have died since the war began in 2014.\nThe EU imposed a series of rolling economic sanctions against Russia in July 2014. They include economic and diplomatic measures, like the cancellation of top meetings, and travel bans and asset freezes on people linked to the annexation of Crimea or accused of interfering with Ukraine's territorial integrity.\nSome of those measures were renewed in December until July 31.\n\"The U.K. will be insisting that there is no case for the relaxation of the sanctions, every case for keeping up the pressure on Russia,\" British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said.\nLithuanian Foreign Minister Linus Antanas Linkevicius described the developments in eastern Ukraine as \"highly unpredictable.\"\n\"It could erupt at any time,\" he said. \"The sanctions must be preserved, to say the least.

Trump has repeatedly praised Putin and signaled that U.S.-Russia relations could be in for a makeover under his leadership, even after U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign to help Trump defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton.\nDanish Foreign Minister Anders Samuelsen said he was reassured by declarations from the new U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, suggesting that sanctions over Crimea will remain in place.\n\"If the Americans change direction - I don't think they will - EU will have to play a stronger role,\" Samuelsen said.\nThe past has shown, he warned, that \"every time there is a vacuum, someone will step in and fill the void.\"\n\n            ",

Economic pressures have mounted in recent years, especially since the price of oil \u2013 Venezuela\u2019s chief export \u2013 began falling in 2014. Venezuelans face chronic, severe shortages of food, medicine and other basics in what once was Latin America\u2019s wealthiest country.\nWednesday\u2019s mass protest falls on a significant date for Venezuelans: On April 19, 1810, Venezuelans began their quest for independence from Spain.\nFILE - Opposition marchers protest the Maduro government in Caracas April 10, 2017. Massive pro- and anti-government demonstrations are planned for Wednesday in Venezuela.\nConcern over bloodshed\nMaduro faces intensifying pressure, from internal political foes and from international bodies such as the Organization of American States, to back off from violence. \nOn Monday, Latin American leaders counseled against further bloodshed.\n\"We view with serious concern the militarization of Venezuelan society. We call for good sense,\" Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said in a tweet Tuesday, according to the AFP news service.\nColombia is among 11 Latin American countries \u2013 including Brazil, Argentina and Mexico \u2013 urging peaceful demonstrations Wednesday. They called upon Venezuela\u2019s government to respect the constitutional right to peaceful protest.\nOn Tuesday, the Venezuelan Penal Forum, an NGO, said security forces in the country have carried out 538 arrests since early April. It said that as of Monday, 241 people were being detained. It also reported multiple instances of torture and cruelty to detainees.\nVOA's Carol Guensburg and VOA Spanish service intern Goldy Fogel contributed to this report from Washington.\n\n            ",

As his co-workers frantically fled the room, he shot Wayne Chan in the back, and then walked up to him and \u201cfinished him.\u201d Mike Lefiti was fleeing from the building when Lam went out onto the street and shot him, Cilia said witnesses told him.\n\u201cIt's senseless. I can't think of anything. Why him? Why them?\u201d Cilia asked. \u201cI can't put it together.\u201d\nOfficials late Wednesday confirmed San Francisco residents Louie, 50, and Chan, 56, and 46-year-old Lefiti, of Hercules, were killed in the shooting. \nTwo other UPS employees were wounded, but Cilia said both were released from the hospital.\nAmid a barrage of gunfire, some workers sought refuge on the roof of the four-story facility, while others ran outside and pounded on the windows of a public bus, witnesses said.\n\u201cThey were screaming, 'Go! Go! Go!'\u201d said Jessica Franklin, 30, who was riding to work when the bus made a regular stop in front of the UPS facility. \u201cAs they got on the bus, they were all ducking.\u201d\nAuto shop owner Robert Kim said he saw \u201ca mob of UPS drivers\u201d running down the street screaming \u201cShooter! Shooter!\u201d\nThe shooting prompted a massive police response in one of the city's industrial neighborhoods, about 2 miles (3 kilometers) from downtown San Francisco, Assistant Police Chief Toney Chaplin told reporters.\nUPS spokesman Steve Gaut said the shooter was a company employee. A San Francisco Police Department official identified Lam, 38, and said he's from San Francisco but had no immediate details on his background.\nThe official spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing.\nLefiti's cousin, Mack Toia, told KGO-TV he was at the UPS facility waiting to pick up Lefiti when shots rang out. He left his van and saw his cousin sprawled on concrete behind a gate, Toia said.\n\u201cThe police officers were right on the scene just like that. I got to touch him, but I couldn't hug him,\u201d Toia said. \u201cThey just pushed me away because they were trying to resuscitate him.\u201d\nCo-worker Isaiah Miggins said he saw Lefiti, known as \u201cBig Mike,\u201d as he arrived for work just before 9 a.m., a few minutes before the shooting started. \u201cHe was a joyful man. Always happy,\u201d Miggins said.\nOn social media, heartbroken family members of Lefiti recalled him as a warm-spirited man devoted to his children and family. A photo on his Facebook page shows Lefiti in his brown UPS uniform holding a trophy. He also posted photos of his UPS truck and an award for 15 years of service to the company in 2015.\nChaplin said police have not determined a motive.\nA 30-year-old tech worker who lives across the street from the warehouse said he heard up to eight gunshots.\n\u201cThey were all in rapid succession,\u201d said Raymond Deng. \u201cIt was like tat, tat, tat, tat, tat, tat, tat.\u201d\nDeng watched from his window in the Potrero Hill section of San Francisco as workers fled the building. He said another group of about 10 people gathered on the roof and held up their hands waving for help.\n\u201cI saw police officers go up from the ramp and then storm the buildings,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's crazy.\u201d\nOfficers found two victims outside and others inside and pulled the wounded to safety as they confronted the gunman, who was armed with an \u201cassault pistol,\u201d Chaplin said.\n\u201cThe suspect put the gun to his head and discharged the weapon,\u201d Chaplin said, adding that police did not fire any shots. Two guns were recovered at the scene, he said.\nThe shooting occurred the same day a gunman opened fire on Republican lawmakers at a congressional baseball practice in Virginia, wounding U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana and several others.\n\n            ",

Use the following format: Answer:<answer>. \n            \n            Here is the Question and Context.\n            Question:What did people do in response to the weapon in the image?.\n            Context:Syria Faces Panic, Bluster and Uncertainty in Wake of US Retaliation\nFirst there was panic, then bluster.\nThe alert the U.S. military gave Russia on Thursday of an upcoming cruise missile strike was quickly circulated by Russian officials to their Syrian counterparts. Fearing the al-Shayrat air base might not be the only target, many fled Damascus or hustled their families out of the Syrian capital, according to a Syrian businessman with links to the government of President Bashar al-Assad.\nThe reaction, he told VOA, was much the same back in August 2013 when Assad loyalists had expected then-U.S. President Barack Obama to match words and deeds and order airstrikes on government targets in the capital as punishment for the use of sarin gas on a rebellious Damascus suburb.\nAs the sun rose Friday in Damascus and the cruise strike appeared to be over, panic turned into bluster.\nSyria's information minister, Ramez Turjman, shrugged off the strike.\nFILE - This Oct. 7, 2016, satellite image released by the U.S. Department of Defense shows the al-Shayrat air base in Syria. The U.S. blasted a Syrian air base with a barrage of cruise missiles on April 7, 2017.\n\"I believe this strike was limited in time and space, and it was expected,\" he told Syrian state television in a phone interview.\nState media relayed a terse statement from the country's military command, accusing the United States of an outrageous act of aggression as it confirmed the missile strike had targeted an air base in central Syria, \"which had led to losses.\"\nThe governor of Syria's Homs province, Talal Barazi, also interviewed on Syrian state television, and again by phone, said the strike and any further targeting by the U.S. wouldn't divert the government. \"Syrian leadership and Syrian policy will not change,\" he said.\nShift in dynamic\nIn its broader outlines, say analysts, maybe the war policy of the Assad regime won't be changed because of one barrage of 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles. But at the very least, it will give the regime pause before using chemical weapons again, says Charles Lister, an analyst at the Middle East Institute, a Washington research institution.\nFILE - A still image taken from a video posted to a social media website on April 4, 2017, shows people lying on the ground, said to be in the town of Khan Sheikhoun, after what rescue workers described as a suspected gas attack in rebel-held Idlib, Syria.\nLike other analysts, Lister argues the dynamic in Syria has been shifted. While the intervention \u2014 punishment for the alleged use earlier this week of sarin gas by the government on a town in Idlib province that left more than 80 dead and hundreds injured \u2014 may have been limited, he says, the strike is \"a big development.\" \n\"Regional states will feel empowered to re-back opposition\" to Assad, he added.\nIt also leaves Damascus guessing about whether the missile strike is just a warning, or marks a turning point. And U.S. officials appear to want to keep the Assad government off balance. Navy Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, told reporters Friday that he hoped Assad's government had learned a lesson but added it was ultimately \"the regime's choice\" if more U.S. military action would be needed in the future.\nAirfield damage\nFor all of the regime's bluster, the attack on al-Shayrat will have hurt militarily, say analysts. While the full scale of the damage that was inflicted by the U.S. remains unclear \u2014 U.S. officials say they are still assessing the results \u2014 it does appear extensive. \"The places we targeted were the things that made the airfield operate,\" said Davis.\nA pro-Assad Emirates-based news outlet, al-Masdar, reported that cruise missiles struck both runways and a hangar. It said that 15 fighter jets had been damaged or destroyed and that fuel tankers exploded, causing several large blasts and a massive fireball that was still raging several hours after the strike.\nIn this photo made from the footage taken from Russian Defense Ministry official website April 7, 2017, an aerial view shows shelters for aircraft at a Syrian air base after it was hit by U.S. strike in Syria.\nSome reports suggest that at least one of the two main runways is now unusable.\nTurkish presidential spokesperson \u0130brahim Kal\u0131n talked about \"the destruction of al-Sharyat air base,\" saying Friday in Ankara, \"It marks an important step to ensure that both chemical and conventional attacks against the civilian population do not go unpunished.\"\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based watchdog that relies on activists on the ground for its information, says the base, which covers an area more than eight square kilometers and has two runways as well as dozens of buildings, silos and storage facilities, was \"almost completely destroyed.\" The attack damaged more than a dozen hangars, a fuel depot and an air defense base, the observatory said.\nIf true, then the Syrian military will feel the loss of the base and likely face a severe challenge in the coming days in operations in northwest and central Syria. Al-Sharyat has been crucial in recent weeks in the regime's efforts to repel a rebel offensive in Hama.\nFor the opposition, the missile strike holds out the hope that its cause is not totally lost \u2014 despite U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson telling reporters that the strike did not mean the wider U.S. policy on Syria had changed.\nThe Syrian National Coalition, the main political opposition group, welcomed the U.S. attack, saying it puts an end to an age of \"impunity\" and hoped it was just the beginning.\nStrike\u2019s consequences\nQuestions remain about what the consequences of the attack will be. If it is a one-only action, then it may only limit the Assad government's use of chemical weapons and nerve agents. However, analysts \u2014 and no doubt regime strategists, too \u2014 are trying to fathom whether the strike will draw the U.S. deeper into the Syrian war. Will other red lines be drawn by the Trump administration, for example, when it comes to barrel bombs being dropped on civilians?\nFILE - U.S. President Donald Trump speaks after the U.S. fired a barrage of cruise missiles into Syria Thursday night in retaliation for this week's gruesome chemical weapons attack against civilians, at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, April 6, 2017.\nAnd what will be the impact on the effort by the U.S. and its allies to expel Islamic State fighters from the terror group's de facto capital of Raqqa? U.S. airstrikes on IS, and a ground presence of hundreds of U.S. Marines and special forces in northern Syria, have benefited from an arrangement among the U.S., Russia and Syria established to avoid their warplanes tangling in the crowded airspace over northern Syria.\nThe Kremlin said Friday it is suspending an air safety agreement with the U.S. in response to the missile strike, and the Russian military announced it is reinforcing Syrian air defenses.\nOther uncertainties are thrown up by the cruise strike.\nAlberto Fernandez, a former U.S. ambassador, warns there could be an impact in the battle for Mosul, Iraq, and says \"Iraq bears careful watching.\n\"That is where Iranian proxies could orchestrate a response,\" to the U.S. cruise attack, he said.\nIran, a staunch Assad ally, condemned the U.S. missile strike, warning it was \"dangerous.\" Mosul is Iraq's second-largest city. IS militants took control of Mosul in 2014 and, in October of last year, Iraqi military forces launched an offensive to retake the city.\n\n            "
